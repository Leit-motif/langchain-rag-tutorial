# Journal
Who am I talking to when I say "you", in the sentence you're going to make me stay here for the next 6 months? [[Fate]], the universe, [[God]]? This is in response to watching the video about the solar [[eclipse]] stating that it will start a process that comes to fruition in 6 months. I reacted with frustrated impatience and I petulantly responded that I'm being forced to wait even longer than I already have. Who is making me wait? Who am I upset with and who do I petulantly complain with, When I say you, this is relationship, so who am I in this relationship with?
- I wonder if this entire [[time]], I've been a mystic and I've been talking to [[God]] my entire life. I've had this battle with him/it, however I've finally decided to accept him/it for the first [[time]] in my life. I want to move with him/it. 

Are you spending m o r e [[energy]] working on not failing, falling, or losing what you have OR on envisioning & working toward what you truly want?
- Admittedly, I work to avoid being jobless. I am avoiding suffering rather than pursuing my [[vision]]. I do not want to work at SCJ. I don't want to live in Racine, WI. My actions are [[aversive]]. 

You can't make a wrong decision. You can only choose to walk forward, or stay still. The vector doesn't matter. Only forwardness or non-forwardness. Due to entropy, not moving forward feels like moving backwards. Therefore, the [[anxiety]]  you feel over making the wrong decision, the [[FOMO]], the buyer's remorse, the [[regret]], the analysis-paralysis, none of it matters because you aren't choosing between paths, you are choosing to unfold or not. That's the only choice you're making at any moment. You're already being guided by your [[daemon]]. You call it intuition. Just chill man and get on with life. 

I [[fear]] I'll be trapped with my [[emotions]] forever. I spend so much [[time]] processing my [[emotions]] that I can't harness my [[attention]] for longer than 20 to 30 seconds before my mind wanders. This is why I needed a vampiric relationship so that I could offload my [[emotions]] onto another to hold them for me. It's the only way to unburden myself. I feel sad because I feel that I'm stuck with [[emotions]] with an intensity that I don't want and it means that I met a disadvantage intellectually. I don't have a rich life to compensate as most Golden retrievers have, I'm still forced to live intellectually but with extreme emotional noise, it's the worst of both worlds. The bleak realism of the intellect with the intensity of [[emotions]], but only the bad ones because the intellect filters out the good [[emotions]]. Is this a choice? Because that sounds kind of stupid.
# [[Fear]]

# [[Lilith]]
### Conclusion:

*   **[[Lilith]] in [[Leo]] (12th House)** holds great potential, but its strength is hidden in the subconscious, affecting your **sense of [[power]] and [[self]]-expression**. Working through hidden fears of [[rejection]] or [[failure]] can help you unleash your creative [[energy]].
    
*   **Juno in [[Libra]] ([[3rd House]])** is more outward and visible in your chart. Its strength lies in your ability to create harmonious, **communication-driven partnerships** based on equality and mutual respect. This placement gives you strong relational skills, especially in intellectual or communicative contexts.
    

Both placements offer unique challenges and gifts, but **Juno in [[Libra]]** may feel more **accessible** and easier to work with, while **[[Lilith]] in [[Leo]]** represents a more **powerful undercurrent** that requires deeper inner work to fully harness.
