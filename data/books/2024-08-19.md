[[God]] You have free will you are my child I [[love]] you unconditionally I'll never judge you I want you to play with your powers in this dimension until you can learn how to master The ones that keep you in the highest place of [[love]] for how you use your powers. So you have to this playground called [[Earth]] where you get to play with your powers and see the cause and effect of them. [[Shaman Durek]]

I don't accept this reality previous reality anymore. The reality based on [[scarcity]] and fear. 

Beings of darkness aid you in keeping shrouded in your chosen darkness. Beings of light will vanish that darkness, hence you shun them. Everyone obeys you, sovereign. All [[spirits]]. 

I'm worthy of a miracle from [[God]]. It's okay to ask for assistance. I don't need to follow the logical, sequential, authoritarian, linear, hierarchical, serial path. At least not every single time. I can make intuitive non-linear leaps, and for those, God can help me if I ask for it, and it's okay for me to ask for it. Whoever told me that I don't deserve to ask is wrong. I can't do it alone, and whoever told me that I can is wrong. I need help. I need a sign, a step, guidance. I need a path forward. I don't have to play by the rules. The rules don't have to apply to me. The rules don't have to be an eye-for-an-eye. The rules don't need to be universally applied, absolute. The rules can be relative, and that is still [[justice]]. I accept [[God]].

[[Confidence]] vs [[Shame]].
## Madison
After essentially failing college, I decided to wing it and move to Madison without a plan. I was hoping that something would happen. I was half-assedly wishing that by being in Madison, something would happen, something would change, something would be different. It wasn't. It essentially looked the same as Racine did. Or perhaps Milwaukee. I treated it the same as where I was living at home. I was a turtle. I never left the house. I didn't have a car. I didn't have a job lined up. I just thought something would happen, but in retrospect, without a car, there was no possibility for anything to happen. I thought things would be different, however I just lived the same, so even in new surroundings, I carried on the same dynamic. Wherever you go, there you are. 

I was dead and nothing could save me from how I saw and therefore treated myself. I still needed to depend on others, depend on Unique. That was to my detriment. I was a stoner, an addict. I couldn't even play videogames during that time. I was just a husk that was trying to survive. That was the actual lowest time in my life. In that time, I truly failed, and moving somewhere else didn't change anything. I wasn't able to take care of myself, and my parents had to take care of me. They had to come and save me. I'm ashamed regarding how I've treated my parents, at least my mom, because she did rescue me from [[death]], from [[failure]].

I've faced the lowest time in my life. I tried to get a job, or rather, the opportunity did come to me, but it was for a skill that I didn't possess. I didn't have the neural wiring to speak as I listened. I couldn't be a transcriber. It was my one chance and I was deficient. I probably felt like a [[failure]], I can't really remember much from that time. I was just desperately trying to stay high. That was a traumatic experience and I escaped from it at some point, back to the nest. I left everything there. My parents still had to pay for everything. My parents took care of me. They saved me from myself. They allowed me the home, the base, the safe space in order to rebuild myself. I was able to back to school and get my degree. Going to UWP the second time, I took things more seriously than before, however even then, I acted from a place of fear. My advisor had suggested I transition to computer science, however I let my fear of math get in my way. My life could've been totally different...Again, my professor-advisor for my senior year was working on a neurolinguistics project. I could've ingratiated myself, shown him my intelligence, and been a part of his research. I could've been an academic researcher. Perhaps in Alberta where he moved to. This was a second chance squandered. This time, based on being asleep, refusing to see the opportunity around me. In these scenarios, I had awakened energy, I had grown, however I still had [[self]]-imposed limitations that prevented me from realizing what I was fully capable of.

Now where am I? Am I a drug-addled, impotent, loser? No. I own myself now. I own my body, I own my mind, and I own my heart. I even own my spirit. 

## Testosterone

My testosterone came back and my readings have plummeted. It appears that I will need to remain on TRT indefinitely. This was a bit of a blow to my ego because I thought that I wouldn't need this anymore, that I was changing, that my testosterone was a sign that my life had moved onto a new chapter, that I had healed myself. I'm in [[pain]]. This has somehow caused me to spiral. I spent the last 30 minutes scrolling reddit and eating a tiny bit of peanut butter (more than I had told myself I would, I count this as binging, [[emotional regulation]] behavior).

This has taught me that I haven't completely changed, and that may not be the point, I may never fully change, this is just a fundamental part of me, how I manage [[emotions]] that are way too strong for me to handle alone. 

A message for today was from my body that told me that I didn't magically heal after a little bit of TRT. It also told me that natural methods aren't effective enough. I will need TRT. 

Honestly, it isn't the end of the world. So many people take medications for life. This is just like my thyroid medication other than the fact that it may impact my fertility which saddens me. There is a part of me that still dreams of starting a family. What if I were to become infertile? I don't know how I would handle that news. 

Regardless, I don't think that any of this matters. I know who I am. I know what I want out of life. I'm ready to ask life for exactly what I want, including a family, and fulfillment of my dreams, a satisfying partner(s), material [[abundance]], time abundance, [[purpose]] abundance, [[self-actualization]] abundance. I am willing to ask and deserve abundance from [[God]]. 

## [[Jupiter]] vs [[Saturn]]
I realized that this was my battle with [[Fate]]: Faith vs Reality. I had faith (unbound optimism), that I was cured, however reality, a test, [[Saturn]], revealed that my faith was misplaced, immature. 

But this isn't a crime. I'm already okay, I'm already moving on to the next thing. There was a small crisis, but there wasn't much collateral damage. 

I have moved on. This is the relationship I've had with [[Jupiter]], with faith, for my whole life. I've been betrayed before, however this isn't as painful. 

Will this time be different than the other times? In my previous forays, moved on a whim, I believed on a whim, I didn't have any plan, I just expected the Universe to take care of me, but in both incidents, the Universe did not take care of me.

Regarding Madison, I didn't have a plan. I didn't care about myself. I wasn't ready. So of course the Universe couldn't meet me half way, there was nowhere to meet. 

Regarding my testosterone. I don't know, the optimism was premature, however it isn't the worst circumstance currently, and having to take medication isn't a crime per se.

### My [[Father]]

This all came to a head with an interaction with my [[father]]. He was trying to get out of the bed. He was trying so hard because he wanted to get to the kitchen because I assumed he was hungry. However, he is clearly unable to even sit himself up unassisted so he keeps de-positioning himself and my mom and my brother have to constantly reposition him. This causes them great [[pain]]. I yelled at him today and I finally noticed that he is caught in the battle between [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. He is unrealistically optimistic, in defiance of any available evidence. He literally can't even sit up yet he proposes to walk to the kitchen unassisted. He wants to, and now delusionally believes that he can do step 10 without being able to complete step 1. It is this unbound, unfounded optimism, rooted in delusion, that is his folly. Each time he is called to task, he is met by unforgiving [[Saturn]], his limitations. However, he was quite angry and lashed out at me, he called me his enemy, he thought that I was mocking him, gloating at seeing his enemy at this weakest moment. I told him that I've seen him weaker before. I told him that he's being egotistical, I don't care about him enough to make him my enemy. I gave the example of an ant outside. I don't bother to make a vendetta against an ant. He went quiet after this. However, afterwards, I also felt sorry for his position, perhaps it was delusion. I also saw myself in him, [[Jupiter]]'s folly. However, when his food arrived, my mom showed, that with some assistance in moving a rubber foot mat in place, he was able to pull himself into position mostly by himself. I was impressed, amazed even. He actually had been making progress in physical therapy. I told him that I was impressed, and that I was wrong, and that he can go on his bed escape incursions and he won't hear from me. However, my mom still objected. He taught me the [[Jupiter]] square [[Saturn]] lesson. Is [[Jupiter]] to blame? I always thought that [[Jupiter]] was my saving [[grace]], however it may also be my greatness weakness. Alternatively, this could be the ancestral [[karma]]. I don't have to continue it.


I also learned that he never actually learned how to code. He had picked up books however he had never actually learned how to code. That means that when he showed me Basic when I was a child, he couldn't help me because he didn't have any coding experience to impart.

Perhaps it was the same with electrical engineering with my electrical sets? No, I've seen him construct projects. I don't know what to believe anymore.

# [[ML]]
  
This is informative, but one does not need all to apply [[ML]]. With respect to item 3, deep learning (DL) is a type of neural networks (NNs) with multiple hidden layers. Learning methods to train DL could be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised.  

I would suggest, as a basic, to start with one-hidden layer NN, and then advance to DL, if the input vector consists of very large amount of data.
