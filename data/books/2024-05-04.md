# Daily Law
## The Appearance of [[Naivete]]

> He who poses as a fool is not a fool.
> 
> —Baltasar Gracián [[Baltasar Gracian]]

Those who claim to be nonplayers may affect an air of [[naivete]], to protect them from the accusation that they are after [[power]]. Beware, however, for the appearance of [[naivete]] can be an effective means of deceit. And even genuine [[naivete]] is not free of the snares of [[power]]. Children may be naive in many ways, but they often act from an elemental need to gain control over those around them. **Children suffer greatly from feeling powerless in the adult world, and they use any means available to get their way.** Genuinely innocent people may still be playing for [[power]], and are often horribly effective at the game, since they are not hindered by reflection.

# Dream:
The first sequence I was in a mixture of a mall and hotel that was converted into a type of convention, I was lost. The theme of this entire dream was being lost, trying to find my way out or through, or back home. I believe I was with with Donnie throughout some of this first sequence. I can’t recall much about this sequence. 

Afterwards, I was driving home, alone at night, I was driving fast. Suddenly my car spun out of control and in that moment, I thought I was going to die, I told myself, I was fucked. When I got out, I didn’t feel dead, so I got out of my car, and it was sort of in a ditch but also pretty far off the road, in a farm field. I could barely see the road but it was in the distance. I was panicked because I wasn’t sure how I would get back, it was night, and I remember that the ground was muddy so I don’t think I would be able to drive my way out. The road was farther up an incline, it looked inapproachable. So I looked downwards to try and find some help. There seemed to be a little town. like a trailer park. This part of the dream felt so vivid, so real. As I walked down and saw people, I was stumbling, as if I had sustained some large injury from the crash, I saw someone else doing the same, stumbling into the camp. There were 2-3 people in the camp, standing next to their houses, almost like NPC’s. I immediately felt kind of eerie about the place. There was surreal-ness to it. A sort of horror movie feel to it. Like they were creepy, something was off. This part of the dream was extremely vivid.

As soon as I saw the denizens of this town more closely, I knew they were demons. I figured I must have been dead and this was an afterlife dimension. There must be countless pockets of these mini-hells. They started to tell me that I was a part of their town now, their family, and that the leader would get me situated. He reassured me that everything would be okay, I don't need to worry about being lost anymore, because I had a family now. The male reminded me of an ogre however their appearance was also purely human. It was like two appearances at the same time. The main person I talked to was a woman, a female demon, like a harpy mixed with a succubus. She was friendly, telling me things would be okay and telling me about my new life. She told me about her sin that got her there, how she had killed her last master in order to get a crystal from him, but that the crystal, Tanzenienite or something, but that she killed him in vain, because he had locked the crystal using some sacred tones that were forever lost with him when he died. The demoness didn’t seem to perturbed, she thought it would be okay and that she would get access to the crystal a different way. She then noticed my sexual attraction to her and she was amused, but told me that it didn’t make sense for us to have [[sex]] because we didn’t want to kill each other. She bemusedly looked into my heart and said “aasimar fantasy huh? don’t worry, we’ll find you one of those, just go talk to the leader and we’ll help you get what you need”. Then I talked to the next npc and I was given a dialogue choice where I was either recounting sins or was given the opportunity to forgive sins, it was two options, the top option was worth (7) points, and the bottom option was worth (3) points. I chose the top option, and I immediately woke up.

# OPEX Origami Exercise
[[Neediness]], [[impatience]]

This is recorded posthumously.

I was in a group [[environment]] that I felt was competitive. I was tasked with folding an origami star. I wanted to show off, to be the winner so I can preen and be praised. The only I could win is through going fast. The only way I could go fast is by skimming, skipping steps. I was the fastest but I made the first one wrong. It was smaller because I folded 10 steps into 1 and made a mistake. I was able to make the second one fastest as well, correctly, but it was rushed, sloppy. I wonder if speed is my friend or my enemy? Am I only going fast for applause? Is that the correct [[motivation]], or is it born of [[trauma]] (tests as a child, where I wasn’t good enough, both my fault out of laziness or not my fault based on how I am built)?

# Goals
Grant had asked me what my goals are. He suggested meditating on Habit #2 of the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Begin with the end in mind. He then prompted me to share what my goals are. 

## My response: 
1. I understand that some of this may sound silly or outlandish, but I'm just going off of what I'm feeling right now. I know the following:
    
    1. Goal: get out of Racine, WI. I don't want to live in Racine. I have an urge to explore, [[adventure]], travel, seek novelty, expand horizons. I also have the salient need to connect with like-minded people. I need to find my tribe. I have been able to foster one-on-one connections, but collectively, I simply don't belong here. As you can imagine, I am quite forward thinking, impatient, a futurist, visionary. I am not satisfied with what is, I am concerned with bringing about the future. I recommended the book [[Homo Deus]] by Yuval Noah Harari. That is essentially my soul written to the page. I also know that a person is the average of the 5 people closest to them. I feel under-stimulated, malnourished because as you can imagine, Racine is probably the opposite of what I just described. SCJ is symbolic of that conservativism, that [[inertia]].
    
    2. Goal: emancipate myself from the capitalistic yoke. I like writing. I have been writing a lot. I like ideas, to refine those ideas, and spread those ideas. To instigate action. To enkindle hearts. Unfortunately, that's not something that has an easily approachable day job, so I am still working on how to incorporate that more and more into my day job. I think I had mentioned that my long-term goal is [[financial freedom]]. I want my time back. That is a tall order. By being born into society, I signed the social contract so I need to earn my freedom. That will require skills that I don't have but I am starting to navigate some ways forward. Currently I am navigating whether that means working within the system or to circumvent the system. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.
    
    3. Goal: ascend Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. This ties into the previous goals and essentially is a framework for smaller goals. Each stage represents an emancipation (from my perspective), a shift from an external locus of control to an internal locus of control. Agency requires [[power]]. [[Power]] is a result of action.
	       For goal 3, I think where I'm at now can be described as "inner work" or Jungian "shadow work". Essentially it is freeing up inner cognitive "friction" or "resistance" through removing [[self]]-imposed impediments instead of the standard approach we are all taught which is put in more effort in the [[external world]]. What we are searching for through all of our actions are emotional states. The external circumstances that our mental models have informed us yield the highest probability of evoking those emotional states make up our decisions, our wants, our desires. I've come to realize that I need a two-pronged approach of working on both my inner and external circumstances in order to achieve the life I need. Even if I've determined it's "too hard" or "impossible", I've learned over the last 10 years that the alternative, torpor, [[death]], [[nihilism]], is unacceptable. There is something inside of me that just won't allow for it. I've worked a fair amount on the inner work, however I feel like now it is time to shift [[focus]] back on the external.

## [[Career]] routes

Route 1: get a less intense day job that still pays well. So far project management fits this niche for me because bring [[structure]] to [[chaos]] comes naturally to me. I don't find myself drained at the end of the day so I can bring my full [[self]] to bear to engage with my "5 to 9". That is how many writers wrote their first novels. There's quite a bit of downtime in some corporate roles.

Route 2: Find day job that incorporates writing and influencing people into the day to day activities. This type of role would allow me hone skills more directly related to the act of writing.

Route 3: [[entrepreneurship]]. Create my own source of income. [[Entrepreneurship]] is a learned skill, and over the last 2 years, I've realized that I am good at rapidly attaining and mobilizing disparate skills. This one has the highest degree of [[uncertainty]]. You may notice from options 1-3 a gradient between high to low certainty and a gradient from low to high freedom.

# Context switching
My id wants to have fun (watch anime). My [[superego]] wants to work, productive (read and summarize a difficult article).

I experience dissonance that causes me to vacillate between the two activities, never really enjoying either of them. 

I feel dissatisfied from being directionless, from not walking a known path. The [[uncertainty]] feels bad.

I relieve this bad feeling from [[uncertainty]] through some form of stimulation, dopamine source. In this scenario, it is to get another soda so that I can stimulate my sense of Taste. This sense pleasure allows me to temporarily forget or change my emotional state. This sense stimulation distraction used to be much more intense. 

I am caught in cycles of distraction, always flying, escaping from one [[emotion]] to the next. When I am indulging in pleasure, I need to escape the feeling of [[guilt]], obligation. When I am working, I need to escape the feeling of boredom, restlessness, frustration. I am caught flying between these two states, and the method through which I gain freedom from this cycle, a cycle which I imagine acts as a flywheel, is to introduce a third state, that being direct dopaminergic stimulation. This is the only emotional state that can overrule the previous two. 
## Copilot response
It sounds like you’re experiencing a common struggle between immediate gratification (watching anime) and long-term goals (being productive). This is often referred to as a conflict between the “id” (our instinctual desires) and the “[[superego]]” (our moral conscience), terms coined by Sigmund Freud. Here are some strategies that might help:

1. **[[Time Management]]**: Allocate specific times for work and [[relaxation]]. This can help create a balance and reduce feelings of [[guilt]] when you’re relaxing, as you know you’ve set aside time for work as well.
    
2. **[[Mindfulness]]**: Practice being present in the moment. Whether you’re working or relaxing, try to fully engage in the activity at hand. This can help reduce feelings of restlessness or dissatisfaction.
       
3. **Break Down Tasks**: If a task seems too daunting, break it down into smaller, manageable parts. This can make it feel less overwhelming and increase your [[motivation]] to get started.


Remember, it’s okay to take breaks and enjoy yourself. The key is finding a balance that allows you to be productive without burning out. It’s a process and it’s okay to take it one step at a time.

# [[Shadow-work]]: the ugly
[[Beauty]], [[Abandonment]], [[Fear]], [[redemption]]


## Acknowledge
>I’ve come to realize that I am mostly happy with myself. However, my main point of contention with my existence is my appearance. It does not portray me correctly. It is an affront to me that I am not perceived as one of Terry Pratchett’s elves, both terrible and beautiful. I want control over how I’m perceived.

I don’t like my appearance. It is one of the only sources of my unhappiness remaining. Of course I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I am okay with those situations. I am ugly. It hurts to admit because I prize [[beauty]] so greatly. I am so critical of anything that is amiss, and that critical eye is triggered every time I see myself in the mirror. It hurts because I know that “pretty privilege” is real, it reduces social friction so greatly, my fatness and ugliness adds so much [[resistance]] to my interactions. I don’t like to be in my skin. I don’t accept it. I don’t accept the man I see in the mirror. What is strange is that unlike a large portion of my life, I now believe that I could like the man in the mirror. I have the potential however I just need to lose this damn weight and fix some fixable issues such as get a hair transplant and continue working out in the gym (which I [[love]] to do both inside and out). I don’t like the way I am but I could like the way I look. The major point of contention is, I have been in a process of “working on it” for almost 2 years now. I keep yo-yo’ing or stalling in my weight loss. It’s as if there is a part of me that does not or cannot reach my goal of looking attractive. I am sabotaging myself.

I [[love]] [[beauty]]. I [[love]] aesthetically pleasing things. I [[love]] harmony. Therefore it makes it so hard to be myself while also loving myself. Loving being in my own skin. Loving the man I see in the mirror.

What makes this worse is that time is ticking, I am now aging and so I [[fear]] I will never know what it feels like to be beautiful. By the time I lose weight and fix everything wrong with me, I may be too old to capitalize on it. Therefore I feel like my progress isn’t happening fast enough. Ironically being impatient has set me back, such as when I dirty-bulked last November and gained 30 lbs., only 10 of which was muscle. 

I feel like I’m so close, but part of me fears that my goal will forever be out of reach.

## Understand

What is there to understand? I see a thing and it is not aesthetically pleasing, it does not follow the golden mean, and it does not illicit pleasure, I am not put under its spell. The golden mean response is a bio-chemical algorithm. We are predisposed to like and seek [[beauty]] from infancy onwards. [[Dopamine]] is released when looking at an attractive face. Attractiveness, [[beauty]] is determined by symmetry and mathematical harmony, i.e. order and [[structure]]. Therefore disorder and disharmony are ugly. Features that are disorderly and disharmonious, such as facial symmetry is an affront to order and righteousness. 

[[Charisma]] in ancient Greek meant favor or gift (of the gods). [[Beauty]] is seen as being blessed by the gods. What is beautiful is good is true. Therefore, if you are not beautiful, you are cursed by the gods, you are unloved by this universe.

[[Beauty]] therefore appears objective. It is absolute. There is a competing view that [[beauty]] is subjective as well. What was ugly in one era is considered beautiful in another. Context changes, warps perceived [[beauty]]. While there is a physical element to [[beauty]] that is [[self]]-evident, based on mathematical principles, there are cognitive and emotional lenses which modify our perception of [[beauty]]. For example, the Venus of Willendorf: overweight women were seen as beautiful because it was rare for a human being to get enough food to become overweight, and it meant that the woman was bountiful, had abundant resources, abundant stores of fat that meant abundant nutrition. It meant high fertility, strong offspring, and easier and more nutritious breastfeeding. An example of an emotional lens is that the people we [[love]], over time, the ones we form a deepening emotional bond with, will appear to us more beautiful as the bond deepens. I didn’t experience this with [[Victoria]], but I did experience it with Muffin. At first, I didn’t think that Muffin was a particularly attractive cat. She had imperfections. Yet over time, she became the model by which I judged and assessed all other cats. Other cats seemed to be aberrations of Muffin’s ideal “catness”. 

If [[beauty]] is subjective, then that means that [[beauty]] is in the eye of the beholder. That means that each of us is a beholder. Then assessment of [[beauty]] becomes a narrator problem: whose narrative to belief, mine or the worlds? If I chose my own narrative (which I do from now on, in all things), my narrative is at odds with the objective aspects of [[beauty]] as well as the subjective narratives of other human beings. I need to accept that I am seen as ugly as assessed by others and possibly by the universe as well. 

If my narrative is (that I believe) that I am attractive, and [[beauty]] is subjective, and that I hold my narrative as greater than all other narratives, the major assessment of ugliness I must accept is that from other (lesser) narrators. 

The universe does produce those that are objectively more beautiful than others. I must accept that I do not have as much of this resource from the universe. I must accept that I do not have a certain trait, similar to accepting that I am not 6’5”, or have a MENSA IQ, or that I was not born rich and successful. I have already accepted my [[fate]] in these regards. They don’t cause me immense amounts of [[pain]] although in reality, their absence is far more detrimental to my [[success]] as a human being. I chose to fixate on physical features that are out of my control.

I must learn to accept that others’ definition of [[beauty]] does not match mine. 

I must learn to accept that I was not born with certain traits that are objectively attractive. 

These are all rationalizations. The point of [[shadow-work]] is to accept “being ugly”. Allow myself to be perceived as ugly. To allow myself to be ugly in the mirror, and still [[love]] myself. **I need to show myself [[self]]-compassion, to forgive myself for not being beautiful enough**. For not being born with the right traits, born correctly. For not knowing how to take care of myself in the right ways to have enabled my [[beauty]] when I was still young. I need to forgive myself for abandoning myself. For ruining myself by gaining so much weight. For allowing myself to spiral out of control. For not taking a more active role in taking care of myself. For not getting hair treatment when I first saw balding. I was so scared that I immediately dissociated, avoided anything I was too scared of, ejected it out of my mind and chose to dissociate with videogames pretending that what…I don’t know, I just stuck my head in the sand. **I need to forgive myself for being a coward**. I need to forgive myself for being irresponsible. **I need to forgive myself for abandoning me**.

## Accept

If I would be fat and ugly (stuck as I currently am) for the rest of my life, with no hope of change, could I still [[love]] myself? Could I still accept myself?

Part of my obsession is due to seeking [[redemption]] for my negligence. I want a second chance. I didn’t get one with [[Victoria]] (which is for the best I realize) but I want a second chance with myself. I want to undo the damage, the crimes I have done against myself. 

Other than that obsession, I have learned to accept that there are parts of me that are ugly and that they are unchangeable, and I am willing to work with these elements. I have limitless drive, the [[mana]], soul [[power]]. I don’t need a perfect face to get everything I want from the world. 

I also may not want every single person’s adoration. Their adoration may comes with a price. If I am not desired, then I am also not beholden, I may be free to pass unmolested. Their desire might be a mania, something to be waded through.

I accept that I don’t have all of the features that I want. If given the choice, I would have chosen differently, however I also understand (logically) that I wouldn’t be me. I would be someone that was sufficiently advantaged enough to radically alter my life experiences. It would have formed an entirely different person.

**What are the pillars that perpetuate the belief that I am ugly? That I am not beautiful enough.** 

## Integrate

First I need to identify where this belief came from. Then I need to show myself compassion for not being good enough. I also need to forgive myself for abandoning myself for not being good enough. Lastly I need to let go of not being __ enough.
