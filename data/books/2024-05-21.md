# Daily Law
## The Aggressive Pleaser

> In those days force and arms did prevail; but now the wit of the fox is everywhere on foot, so hardly a faithful or virtuous man may be found.
> 
> —Queen Elizabeth I

There are people who are amazingly accommodating when you first meet them, so much so that you tend to let them into your life rather quickly. They smile a lot. They are upbeat and always willing to help. At some point, you may return the favor by hiring them for a job or helping them in their careers. You will detect along the way some cracks in the veneer—perhaps they make a somewhat critical comment out of the blue, or you hear from friends that they have been talking about you behind your back. Then something ugly occurs—a blowup, some act of sabotage or betrayal—so unlike that nice, charming person you first befriended. The [[truth]] is that these types realize early on in life that they have aggressive, envious tendencies that are hard to control. They want [[power]]. They intuit that such inclinations will make life hard for them. Over many years they cultivate the opposite facade—their niceness has an almost aggressive edge. Through this stratagem they are able to gain social [[power]]. But they secretly resent having to play such a role and be so deferential. They can’t maintain it. Under stress or simply worn out by the effort, they will lash out and hurt you. They can do this well now that they know you and your weak spots. They will, of course, blame you for what ensues.

> Daily Law: Your best defense is to be wary of people who are too quick to charm and befriend, too nice and accommodating at first. Such extreme niceness is never natural.

# 3 Paths Exercise

**Current Path**: I am currently in SCJ, working in Shared Services. I am starting to see more recognition from my immediate circle. I am networking and more people are starting to get to know me. I can foresee that I may end up influencing my way into a higher position in the company. It will most likely be Racine based which will mean that I’ll be stuck here for the duration. I really want to see the world and time is ticking. I’m getting older and can’t really afford to stick around for much longer. Unfortunately, my circumstances may believe otherwise. The only possible path I could see where this works out is that I get a position with new ventures which will expose me to [[entrepreneurship]] and startups. This is the best way to learn how to create my own startup eventually so it would be foolish to pass up an opportunity like that if it were to present itself.
	This path has the most [[security]] as it is with SCJ. This also has the greatest restrictions as I am constrained to locations offered by SCJ. I am also constrained by the lack of industry knowledge as SCJ is 20 years behind.
	This is the slow(er) lane but actually it’s the sidewalk because it keeps me tied down in a place that I don’t want to live. There aren’t any young women here. No one of interest wants to live here. Those with [[power]], those that I seek, have already left. I feel better about not vibing with anyone here because that would mean that I belong here. This alienation confirms that I am meant to move somewhere else, I just haven’t been brave enough to act in alignment with my heart. 

**Alternative Path**: I had thought that SCJ New Ventures would be an alternative path, possibly, but it is still pretty safe. An alternative path would be to forge a new [[career]] path along some different skillset, but still work for a corporation or startup even. This could involve me going back to school which could allow for travel, exploration, and respite. There would be a temporary freedom in that my “day job” would be learning and I would be living off of my savings. While the situation would be dire, it wouldn’t be nearly as dire as burning the boats starting my own business using all of my saving as seed capital. That would mean I would need to start seeing [[success]] shortly to survive. 
	If I were to learn a new skillset, it would have to be [[AI]] or technical to be worth it. It is the only area of study that I don’t know enough about to teach myself because I am missing a lot of the mathematical baseline. I would really appreciate the [[structure]]. 
	I do not believe an MBA makes sense unless the company I’m working for funds it. 
	So the alternative path is go back to school and get a job as a data scientist or [[ML]] engineer or something to that effect. I could make some pretty substantial money, however now that I’ve read the millionaire fast lane, I don’t know if I can go back. 
	This is the slow lane. 

**Radical Path**: create my own business, startup, become an entrepreneur and leverage all of my savings on an idea. I would be burning the boats because I would only be able to keep about $10k to myself. That’s roughly 3 months of living expenses in a much humbler living condition than what I am used to currently (which is saying something). 
	Yes, I would be free, but also a slave to my own survival. Is this even freedom? Yes, and no. Of course all of this is currently written through the lens of [[scarcity]]. This is freedom which includes the freedom to fail. But I would be master of my own life. 
	I can work hard, I know I can. I can influence people. I can learn fast and I can apply and innovate in a way that I simply don’t come across. I am largely divergent in constitution however I have acquired convergent techniques and mindset. I believe I have what it takes, I simply need a path to follow. 
	Unfortunately, this path won’t simply present itself to me, I need to earn it, I feel that the universe wants me to earn it from complete [[uncertainty]], without assistance. I really need the help of a mentor or guide to get me started. I feel that the universe is testing me, I feel guilty for wanting assistance, for wanting guidance. I feel guilty that I don’t deserve help because I begrudge others that ask for help. Perhaps it’s a guilty conscience rather than a cold and uncaring universe. 
	I have some business ideas however they require skills that I don’t have, however, entrepreneurs, key persons of influence, are organizing forces. I don’t need to be a component in this machine, I need to simply gather the right people and motivate them with the right [[vision]]. Therefore what I really need to do right now is craft a [[vision]] worth following. This means isolating some strong business ideas and networking with others, finding rebels and outcasts that are willing to throw their lot in with me.
