# Daily Law
## Don’t Mistake Extra [[Conviction]] for [[Truth]]

We humans are by nature quite gullible. We want to believe in certain things—that we can get something for nothing; that we can easily regain or rejuvenate our health thanks to some new trick, perhaps even cheat [[death]]; that most people are essentially good and can be trusted. This propensity is what deceivers and manipulators thrive on. It would be immensely beneficial for the future of our species if we were all less gullible, but we cannot change human nature. Instead, the best we can do is to learn to recognize certain telltale signs of an attempt at [[deception]] and maintain our skepticism as we examine the evidence further. The most clear and common sign comes when people assume an extra-animated front. When they smile a lot, seem more than friendly, and even are quite entertaining, it is hard for us to not be drawn in and lower ever so slightly our resistance to their influence. Similarly, if people are trying to cover something up, they tend to become extra vehement, righteous, and chatty. They are playing on the [[conviction]] bias—if I deny or say something with so much gusto, with an air of being a victim, it is hard to [[doubt]] me. We tend to take extra [[conviction]] for [[truth]].

> Daily Law: When people try to explain their ideas with so much exaggerated energy, or defend themselves with an intense level of denial, that is precisely when you should raise your antennae.

Marketing is your Queen (chess piece)

USP, unique selling proposition
What is the thing that only your product can do?

Create a brand, not a business.
What is a brand - it’s a [[vision]], a concept, a dream, a Form. 

Fanatical customer service will make up for a lack of features. Fanatical features cannot make up for poor customer service.

Appear big but act small. You want to look like you have mass, scale, reach, however you want to operate small, lean, agile.

Translate features into benefits. What's in it for me?
Identify your buyer, what are their needs
Isolate features of your product 

Commit to a single business. Only branch after the tree has fully borne fruit.

# Cognition - Speed
[[Attention]]

Is my rate of thought too fast? Is this hampering my processing or my encoding. My thoughts occur so quickly and branch so suddenly that I barely have a chance to keep up. I lose so many ideas because they branch off without me realizing. This is the result of intuitive, right-brained parallel-processing, multi-threading. My need for speed is born of a single-threaded approach. I feel hurried because I am bored, impatient, lazy (? this word just popped into my head), perhaps a lack of conscientousness, hasty. This may be because I am assuming a single-threaded process when I will invariably switch to multi-threading instinctively, without my direct say. This is a matter of control, of agency. However, my executive function just assumes single-threaded, it’s being lazy. I need to be agile, be willing to swap, to anticipate that I will need to switch back and forth and when I do swap, I will need to change my rate of processing from fast and shallow to slow and deep.

# Custom GPT Learning

1. Identify and gather your data.
	1. Give the cook your favorite recipes so they know what you want them to make.
2. Preprocess the data - clean and organize. 
	1. Mise en Place.
3. Train the model - using an [[ML]] framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
	1. Analogy - [[ML]] frameworks can be likened to kitchen tools that your cook (the GPT) will utilize to make recipes. Training the model is like showing the cook examples of recipes you would like it to make. They will practice until they are able to reproduce the recipe.
4. Fine-tuning and interaction.
	1. This is like tasting the dish and adjusting the seasoning to perfect it.

## Technical and Mathematical Concepts

Neural Networks
- A series of interconnected nodes (like neurons in the brain) that can learn [[relationships]] and patterns from data.
- I am comfortable with the idea of neural networks however I would like a primer to learn more about weights and activations.

Machine Learning
- Teaching your computer to perform a task by learning from examples rather than explictly programming it.	
- Machine Learning is like programming in reverse. You feed a model examples of the desired output and allow the model to find its own route to producing your desired output. 

NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Teaching the computer to understand and generate human language.
- I know that natural language processig is important to translate natural language, human’s preferred method of communication, into numbers, computer’s preferred method of computation.

## Neural Networks

Nodes/neurons make decisions. Therefore a network is a circuit of decision-makers.

### Weights

Weights are **prioritization**. The importance you assign to different aspects that affect the final decision. 
- Analogy: when choosing a meal, Taste would weigh more highly than the cost. You prioritize Taste more than the cost.

Weights are **parameters** within the network that *transform input data* within the network’s layers. 

They are **adjusted** through training to *minimize the difference* between the actual ouput of the network, and the expected output (training target).

### Activations

The criteria that must be satisfied for a decision to be made. 

Example: “If the **total score is above 50**, choose to go out for dinner.”
- Total score above 50 is the activation.

# Learning

While learning, I felt frustrated, then [[guilt]]y/ashamed, then sad for learning too slowly. I felt dumb, not fast enough

# [[Feel Good Productivity]]

Radical candor vs simple honesty
Overcommunicate the bad news too
We suffer for being honest 
Be candid, be kind, but be straight 

[[Procrastination]] 
[[Motivation]] and [[aversive]] drive by forcing yourself away from procrastination is not an effective solution 

For discipline it is a [[appetitive]] but it negates the [[self]], you force yourself to just do it. 

Unblock method
address underlying conditions, remove source of resistance 

[[Uncertainty]] / ambiguity 
paralysis 
The fog of [[uncertainty]] because we don't know the way forward we don't want to start 

We overestimate what's at stake 
We become hypervigilant 
We stopped recognizing a safety cues
We become avoidant

# [[Logic]]

Logical deductions and inferences are based on premises or axioms that are already known, either as [[self]]-evident truths, accepted principles, or propositions that have been established through observation or experience. 

“Logic relies on known premises or axioms, which can be [[self]]-evident truths, accepted principles, or propositions established through observation or experience.”

## GPT
>In the context of logic, it can be argued that logical deductions and inferences are based on premises or axioms that are already known or accepted as true. Through logical reasoning, we **manipulate** these premises using rules of inference to **derive** conclusions. However, the conclusions reached through logical processes are ultimately dependent on the initial premises.

>From this viewpoint, logic serves as a tool for organizing, clarifying, and deriving implications from existing knowledge rather than generating entirely new knowledge ex nihilo. It's like rearranging the pieces of a puzzle to uncover different patterns or perspectives within the same set of pieces.

*Logic is derivative.* 
# 2001 A Space Odyssey

Today, when talking with Grant, we discussed 2001 A Space Odyssey and how it explores themes of evolution and transcendence. I had told him that I had tried to watch it when I was a teenager but I was too high and passed out. He then mentioned how the [[AI]] in that movie went evil, and I made the connection that he was referring to HAL. This brought back a lost or hidden [[memory]] that this was a movie that my dad had shown me when I was a kid and that recurring nightmares regarding HAL.

As I explored this movie, it hit me that this movie was pivotal in shaping my entire life yet it remained forgotten in the depths of my [[memory]].

Embrace → Exaggerate → Laugh

This alchemizes something heavy and serious, something oppressive, into something light, happy, and fun. 

This is the secret of [[self]]-amusement. You know how to be [[self]]-amused. [[Self]]-amusement comes naturally to you. 

Anything that’s thrown at you, ask: “how can I use this to make myself laugh?”

[[Sex]]

Until I solve my horniness, my [[sex]] problem, my companionship problem, I won’t be free to fulfill my [[purpose]]. 

I just need to put in the reps, whether I’m ready or not. 

Once you solve the girl problem, all of your other dreams fall into place, they’re much easier to face.
