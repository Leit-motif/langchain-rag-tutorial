The Six of Wands symbolizes victory, recognition, and public acknowledgment. In the context of your [[career]], this suggests that you've recently achieved some level of [[success]] or recognition. You've proven your abilities, and others have noticed. This card indicates that your past efforts have set a solid foundation, and you've likely built a reputation for competence and leadership. However, it’s important to recognize that this card also serves as a reminder to stay humble and continue striving for excellence, rather than resting on your laurels.

### **Card 2: [[Eight of Swords]] (Present Challenge)**

The [[Eight of Swords]] represents feeling trapped or restricted, often by one’s own thoughts or perceptions. Currently, you might feel stuck or unsure of your next move, possibly overwhelmed by [[doubt]] or [[fear]].

The [[Eight of Swords]] encourages you to take a step back and reassess the situation. ==Are these fears grounded in reality, or are they the result of overthinking?== The key here is to recognize that you hold the [[power]] to free yourself by changing your perspective.

### **Card 3: [[The Sun]] (Future Guidance)**

[[The Sun]] is a card of [[success]], vitality, and clarity. In your [[career]], it heralds a period of [[growth]], joy, and fulfillment. This card suggests that once you overcome the mental barriers indicated by the [[Eight of Swords]], you’ll step into a phase of your [[career]] where your [[purpose]] will become clearer, and your efforts will be met with positive outcomes. [[The Sun]] encourages you to move forward with [[confidence]], optimism, and an open heart. It suggests that the path ahead is bright, and you are capable of achieving great things as long as you remain true to yourself and your [[vision]].

### **Overall Interpretation:**

Your recent achievements have set the stage for further [[success]], but you may currently feel uncertain or trapped by [[self]]-[[doubt]] (Six of Wands and [[Eight of Swords]]). The direct next step to fulfill your [[purpose]] involves confronting these fears and changing your mindset. Recognize that the obstacles in your path are largely within your control to overcome. By doing so, you’ll be able to embrace the energy of [[The Sun]], leading to clarity, joy, and fulfillment in your [[career]].

**Actionable Advice:**

# [[Eight of Swords]] Journaling Exercise

**Identify Your Fears and Doubts:**

- **Journaling Exercise:** *Start by writing down your specific fears or doubts related to your [[career]].* What exactly are you afraid of? Is it [[failure]], [[rejection]], not being good enough, or something else? Getting these thoughts out of your head and onto paper can help clarify what you're dealing with.
- **Be Specific:** Try to articulate each fear as clearly as possible. For example, instead of writing "I'm afraid of failing," you might write "I'm afraid that if I take this new job, I won't be able to meet the expectations, and I'll be seen as incompetent."

**Examine the Evidence:**

- **Reality Check:** For each fear or [[doubt]] you've identified, ask yourself, "Is this fear based on reality, or is it a 'worst-case scenario' that my mind has created?" Consider the evidence that supports or refutes these fears.
- **Challenge Assumptions:** If your fear is "I'll fail if I try something new," challenge this by asking, "What evidence do I have that supports this? Have I succeeded in new challenges before?" Often, you’ll find that your fears are based on assumptions rather than facts.

**Reframe Negative Thoughts:**

- **Cognitive Restructuring:** Replace negative thoughts with more balanced and constructive ones. For instance, if you’re thinking, "I’m not good enough," reframe it to, "I have the skills and experience to succeed, and I’m capable of learning what I don’t know."
- **Positive Affirmations:** Create affirmations that counteract your fears. If you’re afraid of [[failure]], your affirmation might be, "I am resilient, and I can handle challenges as they come."


I am afraid that I will be stuck at SCJ, meaning I will be stuck in Racine for the rest of my life. I'm afraid that my last two years have been wasted and that I will be trapped in Racine forever.
	Evidence: I don't know how long I will be in Racine. An opportunity at SCJ would result in a minimum of 1-2 years before I could move on. Therefore, if the role was Racine-based, it would be for 2 years. Secondly, there are other SCJ locations, including LSB which is in San Francisco, CA. 
	Regarding wasting the last 2 years, I was a different person 2 years ago. It would be hard to say that they were wasted because the time enabled me the freedom to explore and create myself. I've gone through numerous stages of how I perceived myself, each time, shattering the previous paradigm. It's culminated in a [[vision]] of myself as someone who can control his destiny. Someone who can act in a way where he carves his own path. Externally, it may have been a waste, and yes, I didn't use my time wisely, however that is because internally, I wasn't able to leverage all of my potential energy towards a single task or goal. However, I have grown in this capacity over time. I'm now learning and growing and building skills. I have a more regular schedule. I'm more aware and systematic of how I use my time. There is growth. Internally, there has been massive growth.

I am afraid that I will be stuck in menial, unfulfilling, powerless, zero leverage, positions forever because I am not being exposed to the experiences and outcomes that I can use to get a better job. I am being purposefully stifled by Kendra.
	I am being stifled by Kendra, and while it may be purposeful, it is not malicious. She has her own goals to achieve, and I can't begrudge her for making the best decision for achieving her goals. Just as I am making the best decisions to achieve my goals. It is highly unlikely that I will be stuck as a DDS *forever*, however there is the possibility that I will be stuck in the role for 3 more years. That would be terrifying. However, just as the opportunity to go from zero to where I am today happened 2 years ago, another opportunity can also come to me. I just need to keep trying, keep pushing, keep doing my part.

I am afraid that I don't have any accolades because I haven't really done anything. I haven't executed any projects that delivered any meaningful results. 

I'm afraid that I don't have the qualifications to get a new job in a place that I would like to move to. I'm afraid that I won't have the [[security]] and safety of a job if I were to just move there on a whim. I know that staying here is draining me however the thought of leaving without a safety net of a lined up job terrifies me. Alternatively, the thought of staying here also terrifies me. I feel stuck. I feel powerless. I feel like I need to make something happen before I have the [[power]] to make something happen. 

I'm afraid that if I advertise myself based on my strengths, I won't have the follow-through, that I will have imposter-syndrome, because I truly will be an imposter. I don't technically know how to be an AI advisor, I don't know how to be an SEO advisor, I don't know how to be a business or management consultant or coach because I've never actually done any of those things. How can I demand that someone pay me enough to live where I want to live with the credentials and experience that I currently have. 

I'm afraid of it being too late. I'm afraid because I still haven't chosen a direction to devote myself to, a niche to devote myself to. I have a lot of shallow horizontal exposure, but not that much deep domain experience. I am scared that by the time I finally choose, it will be too late. Alternatively, I am afraid to choose something right now because I don't know whether I will be wasting my time or not, I don't know whether I will like it, I don't know whether the effort will be a waste. I am afraid that my effort is finite, that my resources are finite, and therefore, I need to be strategic with my effort and [[motivation]]. I am afraid that I will fail and waste my time. I am afraid that if I choose something difficult, which are the only things I am interested in, I will inevitably hit a wall and fail. I am afraid I won't be good enough to take my task to its inevitable conclusion.

I am afraid that I can't [[trust]] myself to to have my back if I jump and [[trust]] the universe to catch me. I guess the above sentence indicates that I already assume there will be no Universe to catch me because I am afraid I don't deserve the Universe's help, because I'm not worthy. I'm afraid I'm not worthy of help. I'm afraid that I must be punished for not trying hard enough, for not being good enough. Because I know that I'm inherently flawed and bad, and that I don't try hard enough, I am afraid that the Universe also believes this to be true, and therefore withholds abundance, resources, victory. I'm afraid that my effort will be ultimately meaningless. 
	As I write this, I recognize that this comes from my childhood with my mom beating me because despite my best efforts, I was never able to get good grades. I was never able to get on the hamster wheel. I've internalized this [[shame]] and [[self]]-loathing. I believe that I'm not good enough, and therefore the Universe, the model for which I obtained through my relationship with my parents (mother), also has judged me as not good enough. I was never able to resolve that [[judgement]].
