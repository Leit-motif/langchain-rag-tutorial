# Meeting with Navi

Navi wanted advice for his interview. The story he told me reminded me of who I was a few stages ago. I was nervous, I was riddled by [[anxiety]], I was stuck in hypervigilance (and I still am in some domains), I didn’t believe in myself, I was hyperrational, I was stuck in my head. I had to tell him to get out of his own head. I helped him cognitively reframe the [[buyer-seller dynamic]] of job interviews. I reminded him to remember that it’s a mutual-exchange between two equal parties, contrary to what outer appearances would suggest. It is simply a question of compatibility. If the job isn’t a good fit, that only benefits you. You haven’t lost anything. So it’s safe to be yourself. In fact, it behooves you to be yourself because any misrepresentation will bring the wrong circumstances into your life. Be your [[Self]]. It will allow you to grow, to strengthen your [[Self]] muscle. Additionally, it will also inform the Universe what it needs to give you. It may be alive, it may be primary, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s supremely intelligent, perhaps that is only the domain of Source. It is intelligent enough that it can respond to your call. Make the right call.

He told me that I’m a great storyteller. That made me feel good even though I thought that it was a weakness of mine. Upon reflection, it’s more that I am weak at telling stories about myself because that requires that I open up about myself, that I become more [[vulnerable]]. Because I am unwilling and unexperienced in doing that, my storytelling is halted, and it feels as if I am not a good storyteller, however when it’s stories about others, or about my passions, then it turns out I am skilled. I need to open up.

# Talking with Grant

We talked about the idea of whether matter and energy is sentient or not. I posited that all sentience is an illusion, I used the example of trying to distinguish between a dream and reality. What in the brain distinguishes the difference? What in the subjective experience denotes the difference?

We also discussed [[attachment]] theory and he informed that securely attached people make up 50-60%. I felt like 40% is more reasonable given [[self]]-report bias and that attachment styles are not just innate, but are also acquired through life experiences. Talking about this caused me to realize that I had overlooked the silent majority, the simpletons, the salt of the [[earth]] types. They would need to be secure in order to fulfill their duty as the support [[structure]] of society. The legs. Complexity is what gives rise to the other attachment styles, as well as "earned", acquired secure attachment.

## Speech vs Writing

Speech has a lower floor, but a higher ceiling because its expression, it’s medium, is the physical world and it is expressed through the body in real time. Writing has a higher floor, however it is one-dimensional so it has a lower ceiling.

They both share the use of words. Words are the first stage of processing from raw thought. After words, the next stage of processing is [[articulation]]. Taking words and refining them further.
