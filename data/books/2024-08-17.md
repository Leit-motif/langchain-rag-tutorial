# Journal

[[Jupiter]] Square [[Saturn]]: "It's not perfect, but it's work vs it's not terrible, but it doesn't work."

If you aren't willing to [[sacrifice]] for what you want, what you want will become the sacrifice.

Sacrifice: sacre- to make sacred.

What must I sacrifice for [[financial freedom]], for my Aries 9th house dream, my [[purpose]]. 

You're racing out of arbitration in judgmental tendencies to something higher.

"If you don't hate it, you'll eventually tolerate it." -Malcom X

Your life is your own. It's up to you to live it exactly the way you want.

# [[Love]]
You will (can only) feel [[love]] as you express [[love]] towards others. You can't feel other's feelings, only your own. Therefore you can only feel the [[emotion]] as it passes through your surface.
