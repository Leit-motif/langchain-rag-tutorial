# Daily Law
## The Pattern

The problem that Howard Hughes presented to all those who chose to work with him in some capacity was that he carefully constructed a public image that concealed the glaring weaknesses in his character. Instead of the irrational micromanager, he could present himself as the rugged individualist and the consummate American maverick. Most damaging of all was his ability to portray himself as a successful businessman leading a billion-dollar empire. In [[truth]], he had inherited a highly profitable tool business from his [[father]]. Over the years, the only parts of his empire that ran substantial profits were the tool company and an earlier version of Hughes Aircraft that he had spun out of the tool company. The many other businesses he personally ran—his later aircraft division, his film ventures, his hotels and real estate in Las Vegas—all lost substantial amounts that were fortunately covered by the other two. In fact, Hughes was a terrible businessman, and the pattern of failures that revealed this was plain for everyone to see. But this is the blind spot in human nature: we are poorly equipped to gauge the character of the people we deal with. Their public image, the reputation that precedes them, easily mesmerizes us. We are captivated by appearances. If they surround themselves with some alluring myth, as Hughes did, we want to believe in it. Instead of determining people’s character—their ability to work with others, to keep to their promises, to remain strong in adverse circumstances—we choose to work with or hire people based on their glittering résumé, their intelligence, and their charm. But even a positive trait such as intelligence is worthless if the person also happens to be of weak or dubious character. And so, because of our blind spot, we suffer under the irresolute leader, the micromanaging boss, the conniving partner. This is the source of endless tragedies in history, our pattern as a species.

> Daily Law: Ignore the front that people display, the myth that surrounds them, and instead plumb their depths for signs of their character. This can be seen in the patterns they reveal from their past, the quality of their decisions, how they delegate authority and work with others, and countless other signs.

## Scorpio stellium

Respect your own [[power]]. Embrace the [[power]] of your gaze. Why are you afraid of your own [[power]]? Why seek and fear [[power]] simultaneously? If I had to pick one, I would choose [[power]] over weakness. [[Uncertainty]]/competition over regrets.

Today I tried to work up the balls to talk to the girl in the gym she was beautiful and I knew she was perhaps out of my league but I felt the energy to go to her but I wasn't able to push past and break through the [[inertia]] of opening a conversation on a cold approach. The best I could do was maintain glances at her and go up to where she was walking on a treadmill but it wasn't able to go directly next to her. I wasn't able to truly face my fears today but I took one step closer. 

# 2001 A Space Odyssey 

The nature of early hominids was fear. [[Fear]] and [[scarcity]]. Desperation.
Man learns [[anger]], violence.
Gains meat, needs met. 
Violence against our enemies. The first murder to secure resources, the watering hole. 

# [[Bravery]]

I must practice and develop [[bravery]] in myself so that I will be ready on my [[death]] bed, to take a step bravely into the darkness.
