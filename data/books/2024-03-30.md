# Daily [[Gratitude]]
I am grateful for being gifted, called, blessed. I am grateful for my uniqueness. It is not a curse, no matter how it may seem externally. I become more certain by the hour that I am indeed gifted, that I have been chosen by [[fate]] to do something that only I can do based on how I was built and what I have been through.

## Kaladin fears being set apart
Kaladin fears being set apart if he embraces his [[power]], his calling, the thing that makes him unique, that sets him apart from the herd. It will alienate him like it alienated his [[father]] as the village surgeon. Having that [[power]] and understanding over the herd will cause a type of resentment, or if not resentment, certainly estrangement. Embracing your gifts, your blessedness, your blessings will set you apart from those that are ordinary. 

Do you want to feel good by being a part of the herd or do you you want to do what is right by embracing your uniqueness? 
## Hoid on storytelling
A story doesn't live until it is imagined in someone's mind. The story means what you want it to mean. The [[purpose]] of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon

#to-do 
How to manage inspiration? How to combat being too derivative? Is it me or is it imitation?

Does it matter what the external form is? What matters is whether the story can hit the soul and prompt reflection on the targeted concepts. 

# Aries Solar Eclipse 2024

[[Purpose]]
Haley Comet:

Why do I want the things that I want? Why was I given these desires? Why can’t I be happy with what the universe has offered to me? There is an energy around feeling guilty for wanting the things that I want out of life. 

There is an energy from this solar eclipse that these desires have been given to you for a reason. The universe can give you all of these signs and synchronicities but it’s up to you to “step on the court”, it’s up to you to take action, it’s up to you to understand that these desires are not just random. No one is going to make these things happen other than yourself. 

Aries is about reclaiming being a child, being [[the fool]], removing the filter that blunts the enthusiasm that all children come into this world with. Removing [[self]]-consciousness, [[self]]-policing, fire just is, fire just burns. Giving up the battle of trying to be someone you are not, and just sign in the authentic ways you were designed to. 

Conjunction to Chiron indicates that [[vulnerability]] may be involved. Dropping safeguards placed to avoid further [[pain]], [[rejection]], ostracization. Fear of [[judgement]]. 

Aries is about having [[courage]] to be honest and [[courage]] to actually try, even if it’s not perfect, but it’s the [[courage]] to take the first step. It’s cool to be invested authentically, there is no other coolness to appear as. Show up for your life. Be earnest.

You owe it to yourself. Be courageous, try, take that first step, try, step on the field and play your best game.
