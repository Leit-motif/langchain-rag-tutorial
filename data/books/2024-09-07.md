[[Confidence]]
is the consistently felt experience of [[success]]. 

Psychotically confident. This is necessary for the most successful people like a quarterback who gets sacked. They need to believe 100% that on the next play they will succeed, In spite of the evidence.

Involves a type of psychosis until you get said [[confidence]]. That means turning off a part of your mind that analyzes and tells the [[truth]] about your lack of [[success]]. 

Capture her [[attention]] through emotional engagement. 

Be a contextual alpha. Be a big fish in a small pond versus being a big fish in a big pond with other big fish, not the biggest fish. 

# [[Escapism]]
### Is Moving an Escapist Fantasy?

It's possible that part of your desire to move is an escapist fantasy, especially if you're viewing the new city as a place where everything will magically align or if you're unconsciously trying to avoid the [[discomfort]] of facing stagnation where you are. Cities like Austin offer opportunity, but they also come with challenges, and expecting a move to solve all your problems could be an unrealistic fantasy.

However, the desire to move isn’t _just_ [[escapism]]. It’s also a natural response to wanting more out of life—professionally, socially, and personally. Moving could be a genuine attempt to place yourself in an [[environment]] that better aligns with your [[values]] and ambitions. The key question is: **Are you running _to_ something, or are you running _from_ something?**

*I am running to a place that will more stimulation, [[freedom]], enjoyment, pleasure, connection. I am running from the mundane drudgery of my current resistance. I admit that I do harbor some magical thinking that this new place will lead to entirely new opportunities. I envision it as a plant that has grown in a desert, and will be replotted in lush rainforest. I expect that I will finally get the nutrition and stimulation I need to grow.*

*I admit that I am running away from my current dreariness into a fantasized reality where I am [[self]]-actualized and I have the fulfilling connections with people I'm interested in, those that align with me. It is not [[appetitive]]. I originally wanted to move to California, and I do have some desire to move towards that future, however it is far too expensive, so I made a more practical choice to move to Austin. Ultimately, I just want to get away from my small town, rather than towards Austin, TX.*

### Reflection
I'm surprised by the realization that even this plan may be an escapist fantasy. It kills me to believe that this plan is just a childish fantasy. It was my last hope, my ray of sunshine, my belief that the world is a good place and that the Universe will take care of me. When asked the question, I have to honestly admit that I am running away from Racine, my home, my upbringing, this hell I live in, rather than towards a [[purpose]] out in the world. Simply moving to a new place and thinking the Universe will take care of me is naive magical thinking. While this would be okay to feel this way if I had a job lined up, if I were to move without something lined up, I would be putting myself at massive [[risk]], not because I can't take care of myself, but because I wouldn't have all of my [[energy]] available, because it would still be stuck in dissatisfaction. I would lose steam and  give up part way through. I can only make the leap of [[faith]] if I have everything, all of my potential [[energy]], available for use towards my dream. I still don't know, truly know, the [[vision]] that I am running towards. I only know the hell that I wish to escape, now more than ever.
