# Daily [[Gratitude]]
I am grateful that I am no longer consumed by rage at my existence. I have a budding [[acceptance]] of who I am, where I came from, and where I am going. [[Amor Fati]].

# [[James Clear]]
## [[3.0 Resources/3.1 Concepts/Attention]]
>[[Focus]] is how you knit the hours of the day together. With [[focus]], the day becomes a beautiful tapestry. Without [[focus]], you end up holding a bundle of loose string."

My life so far is a bundle of loose string. I haven’t chosen a specific path so I don’t know how to weave the moments of my life together. I pick up a thread, I follow it for a little while, and then drop the string to pick up another and restart the process. 

What tapestry would I like to weave? I am stuck between two paths. Kalidan and Swordmaster Zahel suggests that whatever choice lets you sleep at night but I find it hard to relate to my present circumastances. The only way to rationalize it is that [[regret]] would keep me awake at night, or buyer’s remorse. That means that I would [[regret]] not taking the [[risk]] to get out of Racine. To get out of Wisconsin. I need to leave, I need to move on, I need to grow. I can’t do that being stifled and unstimulated, unnurtured. I will [[regret]] it if I waste my life away and don’t take a chance at making something of myself somewhere else. I can’t be stuck in Racine. All of Wisconsin is essentially the same. At the same time, I might need to stay for one or two more years before moving on, but I will still move out on my own. I can still learn what it feels like to live alone, even if it’s not perfect.

## Possible homes:
I asked what cities that are similar to Irvine California, that offer high-paying jobs, warm climates, and access to nature:
- Bellevue, Washington
- Alpharetta, Georgia'
- Overland Park, Kansas
- Arlington, Virginia
- Denver Tech Center, Colorado
- Scottsdale, Arizona
- University City, San Diego, California
- Plano, Texas
- The Woodlands, Texas
- Walnut Creek, California
# [[Vision]]
>Anytime in my life when I have managed to go from a [[vision]] to a reality, the [[vision]] has not been a plan but a practice. 
>
>In other words, what matters is not having a [[vision]], but rather making a habit of returning to and revising the [[vision]]. For the big things in my life, I'm always coming back to them week after week—sometimes day after day. As new information arrives, the [[vision]] gets updated. The dream becomes more crystallized over time. It's a habit of thinking about where you want to go with an ever-increasing degree of clarity. 
>
>You do not need a [[vision]], you need the practice of envisioning."

## Envision as a verb
I really like the verb envisioning rather than the noun [[vision]]. It highlights that life is in motion, everything is in motion. Only concepts in the world of forms stay still. I am not a form, I am subject to entropy, I need to ceaselessly fight entropy by reminding myself of what I’m here to do, daily if need be. 

## An iterative process
[[Vision]] is an iterative process which means that I can act now, not eventually when my [[vision]] is finally complete. By then, it will be too late. I can pivot, I can be agile. [[Vision]] should be iterated on, updated as new information comes in. It is still the same [[vision]], even if it changes significantly from where it started. I am also reminded of the cone of [[uncertainty]], in that I will never know everything at the start. As I progress in my [[vision]], in my endeavor, the cone will narrow. The shape of my [[vision]] will adjust. This will allow me to adequately resource my [[vision]]. To make sure I have enough to make it to the end. [[resilience]] isn’t limited, it is partially resource management.

[[Failure]]
>His attitude taught me to define [[failure]] as not trying something I want to do instead of not achieving the right outcome."

This quote ties into my choice that I am faced with currently. Do I take the safe comfortable known route in the present or do I look for something new? The worst part is that this choice isn’t a fair choice because I don’t actually know what my option 2 is, I only know that it is to not invest in option 1. To not pick the path of safety, of what will keep me here in Racine. I just can’t. If I stay here, I will always think of myself as a [[failure]].

# Path Dependency
Decisions or events or events of the past significantly shape the present and future.

# Daily Stoic Embed
One of my favorite daily note features is embedding today's reading from The Daily Stoic. I copied and pasted from the ebook into their own markdown file and named the files by month and date (e.g. 0101.md for January first) and included with Templater.

# How to take good notes
I use the same system that the author [[Ryan Holiday]] uses. I read and highlight with short notes when needed. After finishing the whole book I find out an hour or so to copy all my highlights and take all the insights and knowledge I need from them. This is useful because you need to recall what you read after being away from it for a while. This helps remember what you read and make it stick more to your brain.
