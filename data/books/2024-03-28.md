# Daily [[Gratitude]]
I am grateful for my strengthening attention and [[emotional regulation]]. My executive function. I am thankful for being ever so slightly closer to the gods than I am to the animals. ^35d4ed

# Tautology 
A tautology is a statement that is always true by its logical [[structure]], regardless of the [[truth]] [[values]] of its components. In other words, it's a statement that is true in every possible interpretation. An example of a tautology is "Either it will rain tomorrow, or it will not rain tomorrow." This statement is always true because it covers all possible outcomes.

> “Yeah it reads as if it is tautological to me.”

In this context, "tautological" means that the statement is redundant or [[self]]-referential, expressing the same idea in different words without adding any new information.
