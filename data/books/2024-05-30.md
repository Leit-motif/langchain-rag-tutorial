# Daily Law
## Everyone Wants More [[Power]]

There’s the famous line from Lord Acton that absolute [[power]] corrupts absolutely. People quote it a lot. But Malcolm X said the opposite is also true, namely that having [[power]] may corrupt, but having absolutely no [[power]] corrupts absolutely. I maintain in _The 48 Laws of Power_ that the feeling of having no [[power]] over people and events is generally unbearable to us—when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants less [[power]]; everyone wants more.

> Daily Law: When in [[doubt]], assume that people are doing what they are doing and saying what they are saying because they want more [[power]], not less.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Reflect on a time when you received unexpected encouragement.

Today I was complimented on my question I posed to Kendra in our team meeting where I asked for a tactical breakdown of her and Greg’s [[vision]] for product data foundation. I was glad that Caitlin brought it up and I was even more happy when Mike commented that he wouldn’t have even thought to ask the question.
