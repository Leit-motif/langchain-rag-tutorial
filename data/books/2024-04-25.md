# Daily Law
## Enter action with Boldness

> Always set to work without misgivings on the score of [[imprudence]].
> 
> —[[Baltasar Gracian]]

Most of us are timid. We want to [[avoid]] [[tension]] and [[conflict]] and we want to be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action, but we rarely bring it to life. ==Although we may disguise our [[timidity]] as a concern for others, a desire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite—we are really [[self]]-absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us. Boldness, on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people feel more at ease, since it is less [[self]]-conscious and less repressed. And so we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their [[self]]-[[confidence]] infects us and draws us outside our own realm of inwardness and reflection.== But few are born bold. You must practice and develop your [[boldness]]. You will often find uses for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiation, particularly those discussions in which you are asked to set your own price. How often we put ourselves down by asking for too little. ==Understand: If boldness is not natural, neither is [[timidity]]. It is an acquired habit, picked up out of a desire to avoid conflict.== If [[timidity]] has taken hold of you, then root it out. Your fears of the consequences of a bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the consequences of [[timidity]] are worse. Your value is lowered and you create a [[self]]-fulfilling cycle of [[doubt]] and disaster.

> Daily Law: **[[Timidity]] is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity.**

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Reflect on a time when you felt deeply loved and cherished.

I felt deeply loved and cherished by [[Victoria]]. I want to recall a specific time but I am unable to. Really, I’m not even sure it was [[love]], but I had fooled myself into believing the desperation she felt, her clinginess to me, was the same thing as being loved and cherished. Her relentless pursuit of me in order to make sure I could never escape, perhaps I thought that was [[love]]. Perhaps it was [[love]]. We aren’t in a place where I can ask that any longer. 

I am unsure whether I am being ungrateful and [[cynical]] or if I am speaking my [[truth]]. It could be a fault of mine, but I truly cannot recall feeling an unshakable [[love]] from another. Where someone cherished me. 

Ori could have easily felt that way about me, but I never let her. I never allowed her in, so what grew in its place was an abomination, a facsimile of [[love]], but it was corrupted as surely as my feelings for her were corrupted. We were a cautionary tale of what happens when those who don’t [[love]] themselves attempt to find [[love]] in another. 

I genuinely hope that she’s moved on and found what she’s looking for with Brandon. She deserves [[happiness]] after what we went through. We both do. 

# Quote: [[Albert Camus]]

>**In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.****

>And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.

# [[Building a Second Brain]]

## [[Divergent thinking]] vs [[Convergent thinking]]
Transitioning to [[convergent thinking]] is a sticking point.

## don't need to make progress on all projects at all times

## [[Writing]]/projects
If you don't have time to write a book, narrow down the scope to writing articles outlining the book, or dial it down to a social media post regarding your message.

Waiting until everything is ready, having all your ducks in a row, is like only leaving your driveway when all the traffic lights are green (it’ll never happen).



# Mashle
## Mash is on trial for not being able to use magic
Bless Minister: God created this world for us. As God’s creation, this world is more beautiful than anything else. So it is magic, it is a miracle that God bestowed upon us alone. And what threatens this harmonious miracle is, in a word, your existence. You are a bug in a perfect system, and bugs must be swiftly dealt with.

Mashle: What if things didn’t have to be perfect?

Ryoh Grantz: Don’t expect this world to validate your [[confidence]]. At the end of the day, all that matters is [[success]]. To achieve that, you first need to believe in yourself. You have certainly got the potential to become a real man. 

We live within the rules, and the rules exist for the majority. If we attempted to accommodate every last person, order would never be upheld. What to do about this? You sway the majority to your way of thinking. The legitimacy of the belief itself doesn’t matter, all that matters is the messenger of said belief.

### Mash uses his only his fist
Physical strength, the complete deficit of magic, to such a degree that it simulates and even exceeds the outcomes that magic would have yielded. 
plays the hand he was dealt with skill and turns what would be a losing hand into a winning hand.

### Because of his deficit
He needs to prove himself to a degree that no other human being is subjected to. He needs to walk uphill. He needs to prove his existence against the entire world. 

>In this world, a lack of [[Magic]] is tantamount to having no human rights, an ordinary human would feel [[despair]] no [[doubt]]. [[Jealousy]] of magic users, [[regret]]ting being born, hating society, any would be a reasonable reaction. And yet, Mash Burndead keeps proving himself different. **He’s a fighter, one who battles against his destiny**. 

## Why do we seek [[stimulation]]?

Stimulation is not necessary for life, so why do we seek it? It’s because [[boredom]] is the same as [[Death]]. Therefore being alive is to be stimulated, to seek stimulation.


# What’s your dream life?
[[Purpose]]

I want to have [[sex]] with many new, [[beautiful]], and exciting women.
I want to travel and see new places. See the world.
Experience new things.
I want excitement. I want to experience in the real world what I [[Dissociation]] into [[fantasy]] for. 
I want to make my fantasies a reality. 
I want to feel and be attractive.
I want to have the means to attract partners and to support most of my material desires as I can conceive of them at this time. I would be okay with some [[constraint]] at some point, if only to preserve the carrot on the stick.
I want my [[career]] to contribute to changing the world in a [[transhumanist]] direction, similar to the future predicted in [[Homo Deus]]. 
I want the [[power]] to shape my life. 

## I want [[Freedom]]
An open schedule that allows me to work remotely, live my life on my terms, according to my schedule. At least far as it pertains to going to the gym, taking a nap, meditating, etc. I want the freedom to shape my life according to my [[vision]]. That means the girl I want, the house I want, the schedule I want, the body I want, the mind I want, the message I want, and the [[purpose]] I want. 

### How do I get there?
I do not see a direct path forward in my current role at SCJ. The best I can see right now is that I will need a new job or [[career]]. 

Today I explored the concept of exploring or creating a business surrounding coaching or consulting. Mike at work had an untapped potential, he couldn’t see a project in front of him, and he was willing to give up on taking a leap forward because it seemed too hard. I was able to inspire him to take action by coaching him into following a path that capitalized on his own strengths as well as being able to ask others around him for help in attaining his goal. I realized that I make a great hype man, an evangelist, I am able to inspire and lead people. Mike couldn’t see a path forward and I was able to show it to him. I can do this for others. I [[galvanize]] others. I am a galvanizing leader. This is something that comes naturally to me, similar to project management and leadership. I need to capitalize on this ability to secure the funds to support my dreams. To support the life I am meant to lead. I have what is required, however I must navigate the path forward.

#### Galvanize others
Figuratively, to “galvanize” means to stimulate or excite someone as if by an electric shock. This term is often used to describe the process of provoking sudden activity or action. For example, when someone “galvanizes others,” they are inspiring or motivating those people to act or change in some way. This could be through a powerful speech, a compelling idea, or any influential action that stirs people into action. The term originates from the physical process of galvanization, where an electric current is used to induce a reaction. In a similar way, a galvanizing person causes a reaction in others, sparking them into action. So, in your sentence, “he galvanizes others” suggests that he inspires or motivates others to take action.

# I want to create a [[Magic]] wand
It is a tool that channels and focuses one’s magic. It is an extension, an appendage, a prosthesis. 

## Technomancy
After reading [[Homo Deus]], I have realized that my [[love]] for magic and fantasy stems from a transhumanist desire. My [[purpose]] in life is to transcend limitations. I am sure that magic is not real or attainable in the fantastical or mythological sense, however, in the Kali Yuga, magic can be achieved through technology. I want to bring technology to a state that it can be likened to magic as I conceive it. As a vehicle to reshape reality in my image. 

To this end, perhaps what I need to do is create or work with a technology that augments cognition. In this analogy, cognition is where magic arises from, so a tool such as a magic wand to [[focus]] cognition could enable me to transcend my limitations. Something similar would be neural implants from Cyberpunk or Mass Effect.

# [[Serendipity]], [[Synchronicity]]
What is the point of time? What is the point of events happening serially? How would this be of any relevance to a being that has existed outside of time? How would this make sense to [[Fate]] and [[karma]]? 

Events that happen in succession are not purely [[random]], they happen in proximity to each other for a reason, at least sometimes. There is no randomness, it is all [[deterministic]]. If so, that means that your feelings, impressions, thoughts, are not random, they are not the result of chance. 

This does not mean that everything that happens to you is correct and to be taken at face value, because this too is a lesson, that the path is not straightforward. It is random, treacherous, and full of peril. 

It simply means that there is reason behind it, whether you acknowledge it or not. Seeing the reason in serendipitous thoughts, synchronicities, is relatively benign.
