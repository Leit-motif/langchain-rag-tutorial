You're insinuating that modernity has enabled escapism into "fake worlds", but [[religion]] has been doing that for thousands of years.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] coined this concept as "true worlds". 

It's the idea that there is an afterlife that enables one to escape the challenges of today with dreams of a paradisiacal tomorrow.

## [[Happiness]] vs Contentment

This is the issue with chasing "[[happiness]]" vs "contentment".

Contentment is intrinsic, therefore, whether everyone is content or not does not affect your experience of contentment.
