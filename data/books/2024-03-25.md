A woman is, but a man is to become.

Satisfaction and [[success]] will come as a result of you providing giving value to those around you.

Don't let the world Seduce you with moral outrage, these [[emotions]] are just empty calories.

Complaining and talking s*** is how weak people relate to each other.

Push yourself, build value, share it with others, repeat.

Men's value compounds over time.

Weak people need to convince others that they are strong Strong people do not need to convince anyone of anything.
