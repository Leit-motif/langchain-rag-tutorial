# Journal

[[David Hume]]'s investigation into the association of ideas. 

Some measure of [[pain]] is required to make an effort meaningful.

>"I also am other than what I imagine myself to be. 
>
>To know this is [[forgiveness]]."

"The key is to recognize the signs that the emotional gym has come to you, and to see that moment as an opportunity to build emotional [[virtue]]."

The fragile narcissistic [[self]] is the steward of the wounded, [[self]]-loathing [[self]]. These are two sides of the same coin, which means that strengthening strengthens the other.

Real and active vs illusory and reactive. 

Spandrels. Nipples are spandrels in men, orgasms are spandrels in women.
## "Make [[peace]] with your God."
What does this mean? What's the implication? That you are at war with [[God]] over something? Your meaning, your place, your situation, your [[karma]], your [[fate]]? Making [[peace]] means [[acceptance]].
