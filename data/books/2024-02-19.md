I'm not ta story, I'm a person. People aren't stories, they're people. 

I don't value my own perspective because I take it for granted I'm already here. It's boring. Also my wound regarding failing tests. 

I ask myself why do I miss Victoria. I am excited to teach her what I learned. I then ask "wouldn't it be smarter to find other people/peers that would be interested in philosophy?" I'm then repulsed by the thought. I'm scared because they will be smarter than me and I will feel that I can't contribute to the discussion. I fear I don't be smart enough. I feel that I can't contribute to the discussion. I fear I won't be able to impress them. I realized that I'm not after genuine human connection, I am after validation and praise. This is why I want to connect with people I know are not as smart as me, to guarantee this validation and praise. I am simultaneously malnourished because growth occurs through friction. The correct amount of friction that comes about through equals. Equals means that I will lose just as often as I win. The net result will be growth not feeling the pleasure as a result of validation and praise.
