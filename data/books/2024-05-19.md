# Daily Law
## Demanding Equality

Another strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in every area of life. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and strength. But if, to avoid the taint of [[power]], you attempt to treat everyone equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do certain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who excel.

> Daily Law: Many of those who demand equality across the board are actually deploying another [[power]] strategy, redistributing people’s rewards in a way that they determine. Judge and reward people on the quality of their work.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Think about a time when you witnessed an act of kindness.

My mom told me that she loves to compliment anyone beautiful that she meets, and she noted that it makes their day. I see this as an act of kindness. I also realize that this may have led to my preoccupation with [[beauty]] and my appearance because as a child, I saw it as a source of approval from my mother. 

# [[Purpose]]

My bottlenecks are time (Pareto principle) and [[memory]] ([[Attention]]).

I need to choose something, too much noise to signal.

I spoke with [[Jaswant]] today and told him about the Radical

[[CPTSD]]

[[Identity]] is tied to [[emotion]], identity is achieved to through stringing together emotional events. Through [[CPTSD]] we lose connection, we disassociate ([[Dissociation]]) from our [[emotion]]. 

[[Emotions]] become jumble disorganized are extremely volatile and then need to be immediately dumped because they accept threshold. 

Emotional dysregulation in combination with a lack of a sense of [[self]].



# [You need to stop taking things personally](https://youtu.be/CGIEjak1xfs)
[[Dr. K (Alok Kanojia)]]

Taking things personally is [[narcissism]]. Taking things personally versus taking [[responsibility]] are on opposite sides of the spectrum.

Look at things through other people's eyes. You cannot see identify, only actions. You can change actions.

# [[Philosophize This!]]

![[Logical Fallacies]]

## [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] - Notes
Why restless striving?
On the other side of the veil of perception is the will to life. 

The process of falling in [[love]] is a genetic ordinance, the will to life manifest. Falling in [[love]] is therefore not required to be happy, it is a persuasive algorithm. Being happy is not required to fall or be in [[love]] (you know this). Selfish genes. This also means that you can be happy now, not later. [[Love]] will contribute to this [[happiness]] in both beneficial and detrimental ways. [[Love]] is a tool for the will to life. Tools must be wielded properly to be effective. One can learn first before misusing a tool and suffering unintended consequences.

## [[Immanuel Kant]] - Notes
Veil of perception
We can never access the world of things in themselves. To approximate, need to detract Subjectivity from our perceptions to arrive at what's left, an approximation of things in themselves.


# [[The Prophets]]

[[Insight]] is an attempt to think in the present vs thinking in the past tense as we habitually do. 

# Mysticism

Becoming one with [[God]] or the Absolute (one, perfect, [[self]]-sufficient reality, depends on nothing external to itself), the Infinite.

Ecstasy or altered state of consciousness within a spiritual context.

Attainment of [[insight]] in ultimate or hidden truths.

Human [[transformation]] supported by various practices and experiences.

In Ancient Greek, means “to close” or “to conceal”, “I conceal”. Derivative mystikos meaning “an initiate”. The verb … means “induct”, 
“Initiate”, “introduce”, “Make someone aware of something”, “train”, “familiarize”, “give first experience of something”.

Perennialism - all religions and traditions share a single metaphysical [[truth]] or origin. Has fallen out of favor and replaced by contextualism.

## [Apocatastasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocatastasis)

In theology, **apocatastasis** ([/æpoʊkəˈtæstəsɪs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); occasionally spelled **apokatastasis**) is the restoration of creation to a condition of perfection.

While apocatastasis is derived from the Greek verb _apokathistemi_, which means "to restore", it first emerged as a doctrine in [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism") where it is the third time of creation.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocatastasis#cite_note-:0-8) This period was referred to as _[wizarishn](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wizarishn&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wizarishn (page does not exist)")_ or the end of history—the time of separation and resolution[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocatastasis#cite_note-9) when evil is destroyed and the world is restored to its original state.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocatastasis#cite_note-:0-8) The idea of apocatastasis may have been derived from the ancient concept of cosmic cycle, which involves the notion of celestial bodies returning to their original positions after a period of time.
