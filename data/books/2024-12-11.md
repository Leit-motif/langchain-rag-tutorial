I fixated on trying to get Frosty Mod Manager to work and I just couldn't get it to work. I refused to take no for an answer so I ended up wasting the entire day without very much progress in Dragon Age. I was again, OCD, fixated on getting what I wanted. I didn't want to give up. I was driven by a mix of FOMO and sunk cost fallacy.
