# Awareness

Stopping thinking does not mean to fall below thinking, such as through intoxication. 

True awareness is rising above thought, above mind.

# Treat yourself like a robot

When something is wrong with a robot, you don’t hit it or attack it. You assume that there’s something wrong with the hardware or software. You assume that there’s some impediment and that you can correct the error. You don’t beat the robot up for malfunctioning. We just need to tweak the system rather than beating ourselves up. There’s no ego to attack. There’s nothing to attack. You are just correcting an inefficient algorithm. Establishing and addressing causality.
