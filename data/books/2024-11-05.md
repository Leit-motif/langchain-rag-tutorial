At the root of the failure of courage is a failure of hope. 

The root of your pain at work injured depression is you don't actually believe that you can change your circumstances, that you can do something about it, so you truly believe that you are stuck in this position.

I'm not hurt, I'm healing. 
I'm not losing, I'm learning. 
I wasn't rejected, I was redirected. 

Negative events happen. Negative mindsets make them harder.
