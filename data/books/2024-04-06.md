# Daily [[Gratitude]]

# Novel
## Technique
Frame present day platitudes in an epic way as plot points. E.g. Shalan stating that [[power]] can be a [[deception]] of the [[self]] is the same as “fake it till you make it.”, but it sounds a lot more epic framed in fantasy epic language.

# [[Abandonment]] Wound
When I was a child, say 7 years old, my parents were desperately trying to put me in a good school. They always praised me for being smart, especially my mother. They had me take a test for entry to a school for the gifted. I failed that test. I was raised in Indian culture so my parents showed their [[love]] and affection transactionally based on my academic performance. I felt that they loved me less because I failed. Then, they sent me to England to live with my grandparents as they had access to a decent school over there. Their solution to the schooling issue was to send me away. As a small child, I felt like I was being abandoned, thrown away because I was a [[failure]].
