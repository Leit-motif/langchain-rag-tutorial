# Neptune Square Pluto
In this conversation, I explored my resistance, [[anger]], and frustration towards limitations and the suggestion of accepting reality. I articulated a feeling that life’s constraints, which I disown as “not mine,” were imposed on me by [[karma]] and circumstances beyond my control, like poverty and [[trauma]], leaving me feeling imprisoned and waiting for true [[freedom]]. I voiced disdain for settling into an “average” life, feeling this would be a form of existential [[death]].

The response offered [[insight]] into how this deep resistance reflects my fight for autonomy and the desire to define myself beyond societal limitations. It suggested that while my [[anger]] is powerful and valid, disowning my circumstances can inadvertently keep me tethered to them, making integration (rather than [[acceptance]]) a way to reclaim [[power]] over my past. This approach, it proposed, doesn’t mean surrendering to mediocrity but actively reframing challenges as stepping stones toward my unique goals.

The conversation affirmed that a future of [[wealth]], [[success]], and [[happiness]] is achievable. Key points for reaching this future include defining [[success]] on my own terms, [[channeling]] my dissatisfaction into consistent actions, using my intellectual depth strategically, and re-envisioning limitations as opportunities to gain leverage. Sustaining inner fulfillment through [[self]]-alignment was also emphasized as essential to creating a life that balances material [[success]] with meaningful [[happiness]].

Ultimately, I was encouraged to see each step toward [[my goals]] as a piece of autonomy, enabling me to build the life I envision rather than waiting for [[freedom]] to arrive.
