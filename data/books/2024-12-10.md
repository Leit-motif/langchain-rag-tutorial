I started caffeine again after a reset. This gave me the euphoria that stimulants bring however it also brought about a lot of my "personality traits and quirks" such as my obsessiveness, like OCD. I had started playing Dragon Age Veilguard and I vacillated back and forth between investing, committing to mage and rogue. I agonized over the decision the entire day. I agonized over the decision over playing a male character (as myself) of a female character that's pretty because I couldn't get the male character to look like myself. I was indecisive af and I ended up wasting the whole day restarting the game over and over again.
