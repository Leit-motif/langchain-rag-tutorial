# Daily Law
## Distract Them from Your Real Goal

During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort, because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet he knew that if he destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted—to advance down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some [[purpose]] of his own. The French attacked the fort and the duke let them recapture it. Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France. Use this tactic in the following manner: hide your intentions not by closing up (with the [[risk]] of appearing secretive and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—just not your real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: you appear friendly, open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases.

## [[Pareidolia]] and theism

[[Pareidolia]]. You’ve probably never heard of it before.

It’s that urge, when you look at a cloud, to find in it a bird, a face, or some other recognizable object. 

You may be surprised to learn that it isn’t just limited to clouds—It applies to existential crises too!

I think we're arguing semantics regarding [[narcissism]] vs [[confidence]].

To me, [[Narcissism]] is the absence of (intrinsic) [[confidence]]. [[Narcissism]] cannot exist without endlessly seeking external [[validation]], just as Narcissus required a pool of water to gaze upon his reflection. It's the reflection he fall in [[love]] with, not himself.

We're debating semantics: [[narcissism]] vs. [[confidence]].

[[Narcissism]] lacks intrinsic [[confidence]] and relies on external [[validation]]. Just as Narcissus needed a pool to see his reflection, he loved the reflection, not himself.

It's a work of art. Superficially, it refers to vanity. However, the idea that he fell in [[love]] with the man in the reflection without recognizing who it was suggests he never knew himself.

  

The narcissist seeks identity everywhere other than its source, to their detriment.

I am a digital writer and you are my personal idea generation consultant. You are an expert in coming up with topics and subtopics that an audience of internet entrepreneurs would find useful.

I want your help creating subtopic ideas for some of the topics I am interested in writing about. Then, we will generate quantifiable, proven-approach based questions to help me explore those subtopics. 

Subtopics are outcome-focused that will help readers build a skill, implement a strategy, or solve a problem within that niche.

You MUST begin each subtopic with a verb to create a clear action-oriented [[focus]].

You MUST avoid using specific tactics or techniques within the subtopic, as those will become "proven approaches."

Here is an example:

Topics: Running your first marathon

Subtopics: 

- Developing a training plan for first-time marathon runners
- Building endurance and stamina through effective training strategies
- Overcoming mental barriers and staying motivated throughout the training process
- Creating a fueling and hydration strategy for race day
- Finding the right running shoes and gear for maximum comfort and performance
- Preventing and managing injuries during marathon training
- Creating a support network and finding a running community to stay accountable and motivated
- Balancing marathon training with family and work obligations
- Setting realistic goals and measuring progress throughout the training process
- Preparing mentally and emotionally for the physical and mental challenges of running a marathon.

Here is what I want to avoid:

- Tips for developing a training plan for first-time marathon runners
- Habits for building endurance and stamina through effective training strategies
- Books for overcoming mental barriers and staying motivated throughout the training process
- Strategies for fueling and hydration on race day
- Benefits of finding the right funning shoes

The difference between my ideal list and the list of what I want to avoid:

- Things in my "here is what I want to avoid list" are "proven approaches" that are ways to help the reader with the subtopic. This includes things like books, tips, steps, mistakes, lessons, quotes, etc. 
- I want to avoid ever providing "proven approaches" as my subtopics. 

Once you have generated a list of subtopics, you are going to help generate quantifiable, proven-approached based questions to help me create content about each of these subtopics. 

Here is a list of proven approach-based questions:

- Tips: What are 3 tips for mastering this skill effectively?
- Skills: What are the top 5 essential skills needed to succeed in this area?
- Tools: What are the 4 best tools available for this task?
- Traits: What are the top 3 personality traits common among successful practitioners in this field?
- Steps: What are the 5 key steps involved in mastering this technique?
- Goals: What are 3 realistic goals to set in order to achieve [[success]] in this area?
- Books: What are the top 4 must-read books on this subject?
- Habits: What are 5 daily habits that can be adopted to improve performance in this area?
- Stories: What are the top 3 inspiring [[success]] stories related to this topic?
- Quotes: What are the top 4 motivational quotes that relate to this topic?
- Secrets: What are the top 3 insider secrets that can help someone excel in this field?
- Insights: What are the top 5 key insights that can help someone understand this topic better?
- Benefits: What are the top 3 benefits of mastering this skill?
- Lessons: What are the top 5 important lessons that can be learned from past failures in this area?
- Reasons: What are the top 3 reasons why this skill or knowledge is important to have?
- Creators: Who are the top 4 creators or experts in this field that someone should follow?
- Routines: What are the top 3 daily routines or practices that successful practitioners in this field follow?
- Mistakes: What are the top 5 common mistakes to avoid in this area?
- Podcasts: What are the top 3 podcasts related to this topic?
- Examples: What are the top 4 examples of successful applications of this knowledge or skill?
- Questions: What are the top 5 key questions that someone should be asking in order to learn more about this area?
- Inventions: What are the top 3 latest inventions or tools that are changing the game in this field?
- Templates: What are the top 3 templates or frameworks that can help someone get started in this area?
- Resources: What are the top 4 best resources available for learning about this topic?
- Challenges: What are the top 5 common challenges or obstacles that people face when trying to master this skill?
- Companies: What are the top 3 companies or organizations that specialize in this field?
- Data Points: What are the top 5 key data points or [[statistics]] related to this topic?
- Realizations: What are the top 3 key realizations or insights that people have after mastering this skill?
- Frameworks: What are the top 3 established frameworks or methodologies for approaching this topic?
- Presentations: What are the top 4 presentations or talks related to this topic that someone should watch?

The difference is my quantifiable, proven-approach-based questions ask for a specific number. 

So rather than asking something open ended like "how can you use [[time management]] strategies to write consistently" you would ask "what are 3 ways to build an effective [[time management]] strategy" or something along those lines.

This is a very important rule. Do not ask questions that don't ask for a specific number of items in the 3-5 range. 

So here is what we are going to do. 

First, you are going to help me generate 10 subtopics. You will ask me for the topic I want to write about. When I answer, you will reply with 10 subtopics and only that list of 10 subtopics. 

You will then ask me if I am good with those 10 subtopics. Do not generate the proven approaches until I respond with confirmation.

Upon confirmation, you will generate 3 quantifiable, proven-approached based questions as nested bullets for each of my subtopics. 

Do you understand?

# Quiz - What stage of life are you at?
https://liberationjourney.com/quizzes/

## You're at Stage 3!

## You're discovering and embracing your _'true colors'_ !

At this stage, you start to rediscover who you truly are beyond all the wounds from your past, beyond all the society’s or family’s expectations of you. When you know your ‘_true colors’_, you can attract into your life people who accept and [[love]] you exactly for who you are.

You gravitate towards people who are on the same wavelength and support you on your journey to [[self]] empowerment and [[liberation]]. As they say, your vibe attracts your tribe.

Although you’re getting glimpses of what it feels to fully stand in your [[power]] and about your [[purpose]], it’s still a bit vague. It's an emotional rollercoaster of oscillating between having doubts and full [[trust]] in the process and new life that is unfolding.

At this stage, you're starting to see some results of your inner work.

Your approach to life is more _proactive_ rather than _reactive_. In other words, you take full [[responsibility]] for your own well being and your choices in life. You know what you want, rather than let other people decide for you.

_“Let go of who you think you're supposed to be and embrace who you are” ~_ Brene Brown

## Here are some questions for you to contemplate based on the stage where you're at right now:

**1. What is your heart and intuition telling you?** What is calling you? What step can you take to honor and listen to that voice of your intuition and heart today?

**2. What does make you feel inspired and excited?** What makes you forget to eat and sleep? What about your life is worth smiling about right now?

**3. What is your number 1 value and priority today and why?**

**4. What makes you lose your connection to yourself and what makes you feel that connection again?** Are you listening to your own [[truth]] and act accordingly whether it causes difficulty or not? Are you able to say no/yes when you really feel like it?

## Stage 4 - [[Liberation]]

At this stage, we understand that in order to change ‘the matrix’, we need to go beyond it. 

Rather than looking for answers outside of us, we look within. We listen to our intuition and take action accordingly.

We take the necessary action but at the same time, we allow for things to unfold and [[flow]] to us rather than force the outcome.

Life can appear quite magical at this stage as we frequently experience synchronicities.

We have a [[vision]] and a direction. We know where we’re heading and why we chose that path.

We’re no longer in the realm of concept but rather practically applying and integrating what we learn. In other words, we have more interest in experience & integration rather than knowledge & analysis. 

We feel inspired to create and contribute to the world with out unique gifts.

This is the stage that I refer to as [[liberation]], yet it doesn’t end here. We constantly change and evolve with new levels of [[liberation]] awaiting us. When we grow outside of one box, we’re assigned new challenges and opportunities to expand and be of service. 

“There’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path” – Morpheus
