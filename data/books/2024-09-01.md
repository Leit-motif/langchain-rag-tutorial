# Dan Koe - Persuasion
[[Dan Koe]]
[[Persuasion]] is [[power]]. Not only do you persuade others in the traditional sense, but you persuade yourself, and you persuade reality. 

Humans make sense of the world through stories.
## Writing
[[Writing]] is [[persuasion]]. [[Persuasion]] is a relationship to the recipient, an exchange, a transaction. A transaction requires a speaker and a listener. Therefore, your [[writing]] must begin from the point of view of persuading a targeted reader for a meaningful goal, the only useful goal: "get what you want."

>"If there isn't someone on the other end of your [[writing]], it can't really be persuasive, can it?

If your [[writing]] doesn't get you what you want out of life, it's pointless. [[Writing]] is utilitarian, and that's okay.

## Framework - The Pyramid Principle

Top: Start with your answer, conclusion, or big idea.
Middle: Prove your conclusion with 3+ key arguments
Bottom: Support your arguments with facts, data, anecdotes, quotes, etc.

Gradient of meaning -> facticity. Abstraction/conception -> granularity/specificity/application.

### Start with a pain point
Stories start with a problem/[[pain]] point that foreshadows a "goal" or outcome. 

#### Framework - Pain & Process
Start with a [[pain]] point then follow up with the process to overcome it.

Example: 
>If you're tired all the [[time]]:  
> Â 
> - Stop scrolling at midnight
> - Fix your shitty nutrition
> - Go on walks, move your body
> - Become obsessed with a new interest
> 
> You're tired because you're trapped in a routine that has the outcome of being tired.

Wrap up the [[pain]] and process with a call to action, or conclusion.

##### You are a dopamine dealer
Provide novelty in addition to healing and [[transformation]].

#### Framework - PAS(O) - Problem, Amplify, Solution, (Offer)
Start with a problem, then amplify it with a descriptive, relatable story. Highlight the extent of the injury. Follow up with a solution. You can optionally provide an offer if you're marketing a product.

#### Framework - PASTOR - Problem, Amplify, Story, Testimony, Offer, Response
This is a heavier framework, used for landing pages, emails, and other promotional materials. Like heavy food, this isn't meant to be spammed.

State the [[pain]] point. Amplify it. Provide a personal or customer story, something the customer can directly relate to. Next follow the story  up with testimonials that demonstrate proof. If you don't have proof at the start, use your personal results or research and [[statistics]] (the testimonial of the scientific literature.) Now you can introduce  your offer by showcasing its benefits as direct contrast to the [[pain]] points you illustrated at the start. Lastly, a response 

## Know who you're talking to
People only care about something that they perceive as valuable. You can only persuade someone who *perceives* your words as valuable.

If you speak too high, it will go over people's head. You will feel good about yourself, that you have expressed yourself, that your view is objectively superior, however if the overall goal is [[persuasion]] ([[power]]), then you have missed your mark by pleasuring yourself. 

The goal here is to educate, uplift, heal your reader. 

An easy framework is the 5 levels of awareness.
1. Problem Unaware - unaware of their problem and how it hurts their quality of life.
2. Problem aware - now they know they have a problem, but aren't aware of how to solve it.
3. Solution aware  - aware of the problem, and that solutions exist out there, however they aren't sure which one is best.
4. Product aware - aware there's a streamlined (best) answer to their problem.
5. Most aware - ready for change,  they just need the right reason to act. This will be different for each person's unique perspective/scenario, where they're at in life. You're throwing darts at the wall until something hits.

In most social media posts, [[focus]] on stages 1-3. For promotions, [[focus]] on 4-5.

### Sales Funnel
Social posts (top of funnel) to increase awareness of a problem. This will create a hunger in the consumer. Newsletters and products do the rest of the work.

## Dan Koe's Writing Process
- A topic to write about
	- pick a high performance topic. 
- An idea dump
	- a collection of your raw thoughts.
- An outline page
	- organize/[[structure]] your ideas in a 
		- persuasive
		- impactful
		- [[attention]]-grabbing
	- This is where the majority of your [[writing]] happens.
- A draft page
	- This is where you start [[writing]]. This won't take as long because you've done most of the work in the previous steps.

This is a process of distillation. 

Doing most of your [[writing]] in the semi-structured outline step tricks your brain into staying in non-linear play mode.

### Kortex Outline - Elements
- Problem
- Goal
- Experience
- Example
- Novel Perspective
- Process
- Big Idea
- Concept
- Key Points

### Blank weekly outline with Elements
- Hook - start by brainstorming hooks
- Connections - connect relevant notes and ideas
- Research - add tweets, quotes, and research to add substance to argument. To give some body. To substantiate arguments.
- Questions - Next ask questions or objections to answer in the [[writing]].
- Problem - illustrate and amplify [[pain]] points or problems.
- Goal - brainstorm  the goal or desired outcome.
- Experience - create relatability through experiences. This makes you reliable.
- Novel Perspective - note novel perspectives.
- Process - create actionable steps as the solution. 
- Big Idea - summarize your big ideas
- Concept - brainstorm potential concepts
- Key Points - tie everything together.

You don't write persuasively, you organize your thoughts persuasively. The [[writing]] happens by itself.

## Summary
- Accept that you need [[power]] to break yourself out of the hierarchy that someone more powerful than you put you in. 
- State your thesis, support it with arguments, substantiate your arguments with references.
- Use [[copywriting]], content, or [[persuasion]] framework to [[structure]] your [[writing]], speaking, or video scripts. 
	- Create an outline based on one of these frameworks
- Idea captures, your PKMS
- Start your draft by stringing together your outline ideas.
- Post in public. If people don't engage, you're doing something wrong. You may need further education:

# Discipline 
Be okay with [[discomfort]]. Food will relieve the [[discomfort]]. We are so comfortable that any disruption is magnified. Short-term motivational system rules us. 

[[Dream journal]]
Work trip over the weekend. Everyone packed their things. They were prepared for the trip. I didn't have anything packed I felt like I should've prepared more. I was worried.
