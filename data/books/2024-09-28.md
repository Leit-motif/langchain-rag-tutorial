# Journal

I spent most of this day going through my previous journal. The biggest event for the day was coming across my human design chart again. I reopened my wound regarding being a pure generator vs a manifesting generator. While I wrestled with what this means for my path, I started to come to the conclusion that I am finally ready to let go of labels. I'm finally ready to allow myself first priority in defining myself, not the external world. I don't want to be one of those people that shuts out the external world. however, I think I'm finally ready to trust myself first, then calibrate with external measures. In the end, I have the final say with my story. I also realized that things aren't set in stone, my path isn't linear, and that perhaps, I'm an n=1, someone who the rules don't necessarily apply to. Those rules were only for those that came before me. That doesn't mean that I'm somehow above the rules, rather, those rules were based on a model that didn't include me, so they can never be complete.

# Conversations with GPT

- You are reflecting on your career path and how human design concepts may fit into your journey, particularly considering the manifesting generator profile.
- While recognizing that human design and similar systems can offer insights, you’re focusing on aligning your career choices with your personal experiences, skills, and intuition rather than adhering strictly to any prescribed system.
- You resonate more with the manifesting generator profile's dynamic and versatile nature, which aligns with your interest in roles like AI Product Manager, where you can engage in a variety of tasks and drive innovation.
- You're thinking about how your experiences, particularly in deep work (such as your NLP project), showcase your ability to balance both focus and variety, reinforcing the idea that you might thrive in a role that combines these aspects.
- You recognize the importance of continuous growth and learning, and you're contemplating the next steps in your career, whether that’s doubling down on product management or exploring research-focused AI roles in the future.

You’re evolving through self-reflection, learning from various tools and systems but ultimately trusting your instincts and understanding of what works best for you.
