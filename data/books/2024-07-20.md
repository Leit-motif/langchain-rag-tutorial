I don't want to heal others, I don't want to be generous with my energy, I don't want to be benevolent, I don't want to be Jupiterian, because I don't think that they deserve it because I had to work for my healing, this is a (flawed) Saturnian take.


# how to become beautiful and attractive naturally (10 mindset shifts)
[[Beauty]]

[](https://www.youtube.com/@natalieetched)

1. Ugliness is a set of learned behaviors, it's a mindset. If you feel ugly, that's not the same as being ugly. You are beautiful just for existing. 
2. Use pretty privilege. Your face card may decline at different locations that don't take that payment type. Stop focusing on other peoples' hands and play the hand you were dealt.
3. Accentuate your strengths and neutralize your weaknesses. It's okay to both not like certain parts of yourself and also [[love]] yourself. They don't need to be mutually exclusive. You can neutralize a feature you don't like about yourself in your mind.
4. Replace negative [[self]]-talk with neutral or positive [[self]]-talk. Choose to [[focus]] on your positive traits. [[Self]]-talk is bound by time, there is an opportunity cost for every word you speak.
5. Strengthen your aura and express gratitude. Stay open, open your heart center. Your aura is your energy. People can intuitively feel you [[energy]]. Cheat code: express [[gratitude]]. State transference. When you [[trust]] in God, and [[trust]] that God made you exactly the way you are, you start to see your insecurities not as your weakness, but as a starting point for growth. 
6. [[Insecurity]] makes you confident. An insecure person can never be a confident person, but a confident person has insecurities. Having insecurities is a state, whereas being an insecure person is an identity.'
7. If you're insecure about a certain physical feature of yours, stop valuing the aesthetic, and start accentuating its [[purpose]]. [[Focus]] on the function rather than the aesthetic [[purpose]] of a feature of yours. I.e. your nose is for breathing, not being a certain shape. If you have optimized breathing, it could be worth the payoff.
8. Smile and stand up straight. You have worth, just because you exist. You are inherently worthy. How to feel confident in new places: Walk into a room as if Atman sent you there.
9. Stay unbothered. Aloofness. Non-reactivity. 
10. [[Self]]-[[validation]].

# [[EMDR]] Session

I have a core belief that women that I'm romantically/sexually attracted to are not safe. I don't know exactly where it came from, but I get a severe spike of social anxiety, panic, the need to run away and hide. Why is this? How is this addressed?

Your experience of feeling that women you are romantically or sexually attracted to are not safe, accompanied by social anxiety, panic, and the need to run away, can stem from several psychological and emotional sources. Understanding and addressing this belief involves exploring its origins and implementing strategies to change it.

### Potential Origins

1. **Past Traumas**: 
   - **[[Relationships]]**: Negative experiences in past [[relationships]], such as betrayal, [[rejection]], or emotional [[pain]], can lead to a generalized belief that future romantic interests are unsafe.
   - **Family Dynamics**: Childhood experiences, including the [[relationships]] you observed between your parents or between other adults, can influence your perceptions of romantic [[relationships]].
   - **Abuse**: Any history of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse can contribute to a sense of danger associated with intimacy and [[vulnerability]].

2. **Attachment Style**:
   - **Insecure Attachment**: An insecure attachment style developed in childhood, such as anxious or avoidant attachment, can manifest as fear and anxiety in adult romantic [[relationships]].
   - **Fear of [[Rejection]] or [[Abandonment]]**: These fears can lead to heightened anxiety and the belief that getting close to someone will result in emotional harm.

3. **[[Self-Esteem]] and [[Self]]-Worth**:
   - **Negative [[Self]]-Perception**: Low [[self-esteem]] and negative beliefs about your own worthiness can create anxiety and the belief that someone you are attracted to will ultimately reject or hurt you.
   - ==**Fear of Intimacy**: Difficulty in accepting oneself and being vulnerable can lead to [[anxiety]] about forming close [[relationships]].==

### Addressing the Belief

1. **Therapy**:
   - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: CBT can help you identify and challenge negative beliefs and thought patterns. A therapist can guide you in re-framing your thoughts and developing healthier perspectives on [[relationships]].
   - **Exposure Therapy**: Gradual exposure to situations that trigger anxiety, combined with coping strategies, can help reduce the fear response over time.
   - **[[Trauma]]-Focused Therapy**: If past [[trauma]] is a factor, therapies such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ([[EMDR]]) can help process and heal from traumatic experiences.

2. **[[Self]]-Reflection and Journaling**:
   - **Identify Triggers**: Reflect on specific situations that trigger your anxiety. Understanding the contexts can help you address underlying fears.
   - **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: Write down your beliefs and challenge their validity. Replace them with more positive, realistic thoughts.

3. **Building [[Self-Esteem]]**:
   - **[[Self]]-Compassion**: Practice [[self]]-compassion and work on building a positive [[self]]-image. Acknowledge your strengths and achievements.
   - **[[Mindfulness]] and [[Meditation]]**: Techniques that promote [[mindfulness]] can help you stay present and reduce anxiety.

4. **Gradual Exposure**:
   - **Socializing**: Gradually increase your comfort level by engaging in social activities that do not necessarily involve romantic interests. Build [[confidence]] in social interactions.
   - **Positive Experiences**: Seek out and create positive interactions with women in non-romantic contexts to challenge your belief and reduce anxiety.

5. **Support Systems**:
   - **Friends and Family**: Rely on supportive friends and family who can provide reassurance and help you feel safe.
   - **Support Groups**: Consider joining support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others facing similar challenges.

6. **Healthy Boundaries**:
   - **Establish Boundaries**: Setting clear boundaries in [[relationships]] can help you feel more in control and safe, reducing anxiety.

### Conclusion

Addressing this core belief requires a multifaceted approach, combining [[self]]-exploration, professional therapy, and gradual exposure to anxiety-inducing situations. Understanding the root cause is crucial, and working on building [[self-esteem]], challenging negative thoughts, and creating positive experiences will help you develop healthier [[relationships]] and reduce anxiety over time.
