# Daily Law
## The Subtle-Superiority Strategy

A friend, colleague, or employee is chronically late, but he or she always has a ready excuse that is logical, along with an apology that seems sincere. Or similarly, such individuals forget about meetings, important dates, and deadlines, always with impeccable excuses at hand. If this behavior repeats often enough, your irritation will increase, but if you try to confront them, they very well might try to turn the tables by making you seem uptight and unsympathetic. It is not their fault, they say—they have too much on their mind, people are pressuring them, they are temperamental artists who can’t keep on top of so many irritating details, they are overwhelmed. They may even accuse you of adding to their stress. *You must understand that at the root of this is the need to make it clear to themselves and to you that they are in some way superior*. If they were to say in so many words that they felt superior to you, they would incur ridicule and [[shame]]. They want you to feel it in subtle ways, while they are able to deny what they are up to. Putting you in the inferior position is a form of control, in which they get to define the relationship. You must pay attention to the pattern more than the apologies. They are not really sorry.

> Daily Law: If this is chronic behavior, you must not get angry or display overt irritation—*passive aggressors thrive on getting a rise out of you*. Instead, **stay calm and subtly mirror their behavior**, calling attention to what they are doing, and inducing some [[shame]] if possible.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Write about a time when you faced a challenge with [[determination]].

I had just been introduced to [[Power]] BI and had not had any real world experience. My manager’s manager had tasked me with creating an entire dashboard within a week’s time without any prior notice. I found the request unfair but a part of me relished in the challenge, the grind. Instead of giving up or making excuses, I found myself bringing myself to bear, of gritting my teeth and working the entire workday as well as evenings and even the weekend. For me, it wasn’t just the task itself, rather, I knew this project was an opportunity to show off my skills to Kendra and the rest of the team. I wanted to make a spectacle of it so I knew that it couldn’t just be good, it had to be amazing. All of my hard work and [[determination]] paid off because I built a dashboard that I felt exceeded anyone’s expectations. At the time, I felt extremely proud of my feat and although office politics ended up interfering with my hope of establishing myself as an analytics person, I am still impressed with myself for delivering something of such sophistication in such a short time frame. The thing that makes me most happy, that I most grateful for, is that I have a fathomless reservoir of grit, [[determination]], energy, drive, talent, and effort that I can bring to bear if properly motivated.

# The [[Alchemy]] of [[DIKW]]
is the act of progressive summarization + semanticization from data to [[wisdom]]. We imbue meaning (spirit) into data (matter) to transmute it into something new, a mixture of both. We create life. We are gods. 

Imbuement is difficult, it is a costly activity, so we need to reduce the surface area in order to cast an imbuement spell with our available [[mana]].

We alchemize data into [[wisdom]]. What is the Philosopher’s Stone in this context?

The [[Philosopher’s Stone]] would aid in imbuing meaning, semanticization. So far, humans are the only entities that imbue meaning. How can an object imbue meaning? Is there artificial meaning? Does semanticization require consciousness? An actor? An observer? A knower? Meaning is that which can be known, an object of knowing. Does one need to be a knower in order to create things that are known? Or to assign a tag of meaning? 

Semanticization is a challenge for [[AI]]. Empiricism only determines what was known, but it does not actually understand the foot that caused the footprint. It does not understand the walker, the path the walker was taking, the [[motivation]] for choosing the path the walker took. 

## The [[Philosopher’s Stone]]

A legendary substance in [[alchemy]] believed to have two main functions:
1. **Transmutation**: capable of turning base metals such as mercury into precious metals like gold and silver.
2. **Elixer of Life**: the stone was also thought to produce the Elixer of Life, which could grant rejuvenation and even immortality.

Symbolizes perfection, divine illumination, and heavenly bliss.

The Magnum Opus (“Great Work”) was to discover the Philosopher’s Stone. 

## Functions

How does the stone work? By what method does it transmute? What [[purpose]] does it serve within the creation of the Elixer of Life?

Choices
Your circumstances are the result of your choices. A series of choices over time build, compound into the processes which shape your life. 

choice informs process process informs lifestyle. 

You are where you chose to be.

There are treasonous choices that rob you or your life. 

At high speeds, a minor shift can have disasterous consequences. choice horsepower. Impact differential. Butterfly effect. 

choice Horsepower erodes as the consequences of old choices harden and become difficult to bend.

choice of perception vs choice of actions. Change your perception in order to change your actions. 
Words like never in can't versus words like can and how? 
A job is just as risky as a business.

Your past never guides your future unless you allow it.

If the universe doesn’t remember it, why should you?

Probability theory vs path dependency.

Framing [[failure]] to serve rather than hinder.

Societal headwinds. Headwinds are friction that you need to navigate. Dreamstealers.

# [[Saturn]] 
teaches by forcing you to learn and grow in few skills that you didn't think you had. 

[[Saturn]] races the bar in order to teach you hard lessons, it may constantly keep raising the bar. 

We may be stuck in the cycle of [[Saturn]] where the friction continuously increases and we don't get to feel the satisfaction of achievement. [[Self-esteem]], [[confidence]]. 

The difference between a teacher and a mentor. A mental helps you to be the best that you can possibly be by both helping what you're trying to learn but also helping you learn how to become the best at what you're trying to learn. 

# you're not alone in here
Parts, [[daemon]], guardian angels.

# [Cody Rall’s Morning Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwebuYKZtRo)

Write what you want to accomplish in the future (in his example, it was 2 years in the future), but describe it in the past tense. Then he meditates to get to that peak state change at the end of the [[meditation]] session. Last he visualizes what he had written earlier. [[Writing]] and visualizing what you wrote works to solidify your [[vision]] and also primes your selective attention to notice more opportunities that align with your [[vision]]. Spiritually, this practice of concentrated consciousness helps the universe to conspire to bring me these opportunities to help me achieve these goals. [[Consciousness]] enables consciousness. Events/[[karma]] are reshaped to maximize growth.
