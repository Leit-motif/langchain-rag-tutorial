# Journal

Today, I studied the [[4th house]] in [[astrology]]. I learned that the [[4th house]] refers to one's emotional home, one's sanctuary, one's foundation. The video from [[astrology]] hub podcast, also mentioned that [[security]] was the primary solve for this house. 

I also saw a [[Leo]] Rising video that stated that [[Leo]] risings will have [[Scorpio]] in the [[4th house]] which makes control, or the lack of it in childhood, a guiding principle in their adult life.

I've realized that in order to do anything else in life, I need to solve for my emotional [[security]]. I was reassured that that is what I've been focusing on for the last 3 years. There is a [[time]] and place for every domain of life, however this season of life is  primarily devoted to solving my heart. Once my heart is solved, all of my gifts in my [[Scorpio]] stellium will be awakened.

Speaking of awakening and [[transformation]], I was moved by the image of a snake shedding its skin. It grows until its skin is so tight that it hurts to breath. The skin is your life circumstances. You must wander in [[pain]], fighting against your own [[growth]], the [[growth]] being interpreted as negative because it causes you [[pain]], even though it is positive as it gives you more [[power]], leverage. One day, the tension is so great, that the skin cracks down the middle, your old life cracks. You leave that husk, that shell behind. The transition between old skin and new is tenuous because the new fresh skin is still slightly soft and vulnerable. 

# Libra Solar Eclipse conjunct natal Mars

- **Astrological Context and Rebalancing Assertiveness**
    
    - The [[solar eclipse]] conjunct your natal [[Mars]] in [[Libra]] highlights a need to adjust how you assert yourself, balancing [[ambition]] with diplomacy to achieve harmony in [[relationships]].
- **[[Mars]] in [[Libra]]: Balancing Drive with Harmony**
    
    - [[Mars]] represents [[ambition]], but in [[Libra]], it seeks balance and diplomacy, leading to potential conflict between assertiveness and the desire for harmony. The [[eclipse]] pushes you to find a middle ground in communication.
- **[[Eclipse]] and South Node: Letting Go of Old Patterns**
    
    - The South Node, alongside the [[eclipse]], signals the need to release old habits like over-assertiveness or combativeness, especially when it creates unnecessary friction in [[relationships]] or work dynamics.
- **[[Ambition]], Transparency, and Recalibration**
    
    - Your [[ambition]] and transparency are strengths, but if perceived as overly direct or intimidating, they may create tension. The [[eclipse]] calls for recalibrating how you express your ambitions to align with [[Libra]]'s balanced [[energy]].
- **Adopting a Diplomatic Approach**
    
    - While transparency can be beneficial, it may be seen as disruptive in certain environments. The [[eclipse]] encourages adopting a diplomatic approach—not as inauthenticity but as strategic maneuvering to avoid resistance.
- **[[Power]] Dynamics and Pluto’s Influence**
    
    - Pluto’s influence suggests that [[power]] struggles might be intensifying challenges in asserting yourself. The key is adopting a more strategic approach to [[power]] dynamics to avoid unnecessary confrontation.
- **Practical Steps for Moving Forward**
    
    - **Reflect on Communication**: Assess if your communication style is too forceful and adjust for a more balanced approach.
    - **Balance Assertiveness and Diplomacy**: Aim to assert yourself without creating conflict, in alignment with [[Libra]]’s [[energy]] of harmony.
    - **Strategic Use of [[Mars]]’ [[Energy]]**: Understand and navigate [[power]] dynamics strategically to pursue your goals effectively.
    - **Adopt a Nuanced Approach**: In environments resistant to directness, consider a more subtle way of communicating while maintaining clarity in your objectives.
- **Conclusion: Path Toward Balanced Leadership**
    
    - The [[eclipse]] calls for releasing old, unproductive assertive patterns and adopting a more harmonious, strategic approach that allows you to assert yourself effectively while fostering cooperative [[relationships]].
