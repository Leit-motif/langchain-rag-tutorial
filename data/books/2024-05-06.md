# Daily Law
## See Through the False Front

> One who is good at combating the enemy fools it with inscrutable moves, confuses it with false intelligence, makes it relax by concealing one’s strength . . . deafens its ears by jumbling one’s orders and signals, blinds its eyes by converting one’s banners and insignias, . . . confounds its battle plan by providing distorted facts.
> 
> —Tou Bi Fu Tan

The false front is the oldest form of military [[deception]]. It originally involved making the enemy believe that one was weaker than in fact was the case. A leader would feign a retreat, say, baiting a trap for the enemy to rush into, luring it into an ambush. This was a favorite tactic of Sun Tzu’s. The appearance of weakness often brings out people’s aggressive side, making them drop strategy and prudence for an emotional and violent attack. When Napoleon found himself outnumbered and in a vulnerable strategic position before the Battle of Austerlitz, he deliberately showed signs of being panicked, indecisive, and scared. The enemy armies abandoned their strong position to attack him and rushed into a trap. It was his greatest victory. In general, as advocated since the days of ancient China, nonplayers present a face to the world that promises the opposite of what they are actually planning.

# [[Stress]], [[perseveration]], “I’ll be good enough when”

Your thoughts are signals to your body and mind. You are stuck perseveration on [[lack]], on [[desperation]], on desire for some outcome that isn’t here yet. You are flooding your present with negative thoughts which create negative chemicals in your body. Those negative chemicals impact your outcome on the ground level. You are stuck in a feedback loop and you have to expend twice the amount of effort to see progress. Stop shooting yourself in the foot with this [[scarcity]] lack thinking. The “I’m not enough” which is fed by “I’ll be enough when”. 

It’s not that you’re wrong. You will be better in the future than you will today, that is the nature of progress. But you already like progress in the present. You enjoy progress innately. Therefore if progress brings joy, you don’t require a lack stimulus to motivate you. Even though you don’t require a lack stimulus, you keep giving yourself one. A lack stimulus has an associated toxicity with it. It is a negative thought. That negative thought creates a negative reaction and begins a lack stimulus loop. You keep poisoning the present moment with unnecessary lack signal toxicity. You then need to expend much more effort doing what you’re already going to do because you [[love]] it, but you threaten yourself. [[Fear]] and [[shame]] are like gravity. Two steps forward, one step back. But one step at a time is too slow for you. So you increase your pace but increase the sabotage accordingly. Four steps forward, two steps back. Now you’re happy you’re progressing at two steps but expend the energy of four steps. It’s taking its toll on you. Just relax. You’re already doing what you need to do because you [[love]] it, you don’t need the whip! [[Lack]], [[guilt]], [[shame]], [[neediness]], these [[emotions]] aren’t required as motivators, for anything you want out of life. You are abundant ([[Abundance]]) already. You just need to let that abundance [[flow]]. You need to nurture and nourish it. You need to force-multiply it as you’re able to. Force without effort. You will see amazing progress because you’ll actually have eyes to see the present rather than losing yourself in desperation, [[scarcity]], lack, neediness. Free your present from this oppression!

# Stimulus to fatigue ratio (SFR)
1. **Tension** - tightness during an exercise
2. **Burn** - lactate
3. **Pump** - engorgement
4. **Perturbation** - form gets messy
5. **Soreness** - DOMS
 
1. **Stimulus**: stress through intensity or volume.    
2. **Fatigue**: inability to generate force due to various depletion of energy stores, accumulation of lactate, and muscle damage.

# [[Emotion]]s

Your [[emotions]] just exist, they aren’t there to punish you. You can only control your reactions (to an extent). Just accept them and move on.

# [[Inner Child]] Work

The [[inner child]] is a the part of us that is spontaneous, energetic, creative, and playful.

Wounding, [[trauma]], shuts this down.

>In every adult, there lurks a child - an eternal child, something that is becoming, is never completed and calls for unceasing care, [[attention]], and education. That is the part of the human personality which waits to develop and become whole. – [[Carl Jung]]

The intellect can be fooled with delusion, the [[emotions]] can be numbed or suppressed, but [[the body keeps the score]] of our [[inner child]] wounds.

> With practice, we can see that our wounded [[inner child]] is not only us. 
> Our wounded [[inner child]] may represent several generations. 
> Our mother may have suffered throughout her life. 
> Our [[father]] may have suffered. 
> Perhaps our parents weren’t able to look after the wounded [[inner child]] in themselves. 
> So when we’re embracing the wounded [[inner child]] in us, we are embracing all the wounded inner children in our past generations.
> This practice is not practice for ourselves alone, but for numberless generations of ancestors and descendants. – [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]

## Common indicators of unresolved [[inner child]] [[trauma]]
Addiction
In ability to relinquish control, lack of [[trust]] in life and people
“never enough syndrome” or ([[Narcissism]]) narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) - unrelenting need to be validated by others.
[[Fear]] of [[abandonment]]
Difficulty and confusion knowing what you want or how you feel. (Emotional ambivalence? Conflicting feelings making [[discernment]] challenging)
[[Fear]] of the new
Inability or unwillingness to set boundaries – hard to say “no”
[[Fear]] of [[anger]]? (outgoing or incoming?)
Difficulty expressing [[emotions]]
Paranoia and disruptive thought patterns – inability to differentiate between facts and assumptions
Being constantly triggered, on the defensive – viewing the world through the lens of [[inner child]] wounds, and the resulting [[insecurity]] causes emotional volatility and ungrounded thought.
People pleaser syndrome
Overly competitive 
Social anxiety
Need to have things your way, or else you will quit
[[Fear]] of making mistakes, perfectionism
[[Guilt]] over not fulfilling parental expectations
lack of healthy discipline - procrastination, inability to [[focus]], lack of follow-through, execution.

## Types of [[inner child]] wounds

![[Pasted image 20240506204711.png]]

## [[Relationships]]

Dysfunctional family dynamics are repeated/mirrored through the [[relationships]] we attract into our life. 

Example of dysfunctional family dynamics:
- secrecy
- resentment
- numbing of [[emotions]]
- aggressiveness
- control
- withdrawal

We will keep attracting these dynamics until we resolve them. To resolve, we need to let go of coping mechanisms in order to reveal/access the [[vulnerability]], the original wound. Can’t heal what we can’t reach/access.

### Examples of how [[inner child]] wounds affect our [[relationships]]

#### Projection of our disowned parts

Project disowned traits onto others.

You may feel disproportionately/excessively triggered in response to another person which indicates that there is an unresolved or abandoned element of what triggered you within yourself.

Being triggered by others: this can be both negative ([[judgement]]) and positive (attraction).
	Judging another is a trigger response to something within yourself.

For example, you may feel magnetically drawn to someone who embodies a positive aspect that you have disowned within yourself. 

The next time you feel a strong **[[judgement]]** or **attraction** towards someone, ask yourself: *“Is there something in this person that I rejected in myself?”*


#### Dissociation

If a situation was too intense to process, our only hope was to disconnect from or dampen/numb our [[emotions]] in order to protect ourselves. This was adaptive at the time.

You escape the unbearable present mentally and/or emotionally.

You can grow accustomed to living anywhere other than the present. You may forget the present even exists. It will be unfamiliar territory. Your presence adaptions will have atrophied from disuse. 

#### Harmful behavior towards [[self]] or others


#### [[Narcissism]]


#### Codependency


#### [[Trust]] issues and fear of intimacy


#### Enmeshment/loss of [[self]]


#### Fear of [[abandonment]]


## Tips on healing the wounded [[inner child]]


# [[Sex]] [[Trauma]]
When I was young, I tried to steal a porn magazine from a gas station Pinky Auntie was working at while babysitting me. I was caught and was terrified and I begged my aunt not to tell me parents but she did anyways. What was worse is that pinky auntie let me buy a toy from the gas station, a bag of army figurines, but because I got caught stealing I did not get my toy, I did not get my p*** magazine, and she told my parents which terrified me. I was sure that I was going to be beaten badly for this infraction. 

Parked me wonders whether this extreme budding sexual desire at a very young age may have come from outside of myself, inherited from my mother's unresolved or unrealized unfulfilled sexual desires from the life she has always dreamed she would have, her prince charming. 

Their story (my parents) is such a sorrowful tale, and I am the fruit of this sorrowful story. 

I am doubly angry because as I recall this, I realized that I was abandoned by my parents, by my mom who was so sick and always f****** dying and therefore had to always leave me with my aunt and uncle, abandoning me. I'm angry that she decided to get married, she decided to have children and then she just decides to abandon it all by giving up on life, by giving up on me, on us. 

I had intense sexual desires at too young of an age, had no idea what to do with it because of the repressed culture I come from, and then deciding to act on my impulse, I was punished, shamed, and terrified. 

Like gang crime later in my life I realize that anytime I had an unbearable situation and my [[emotions]] bubbled over and forced me to act as is the nature of [[emotions]] it is to drive us to action, anytime I was driven to action, I've been punished severely. This is cost me to associate [[emotion]] with negative outcomes which then cost me to suppress the associated [[emotions]], and through progressive life experiences such as some of my breakups and how I handled them I learned that all [[emotions]] lead to negative outcomes and therefore need to be numbed, ignored or dissociated from.
