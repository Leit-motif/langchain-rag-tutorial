# Journal

[[AI]] Influencer - you need to influence public sentiment for [[AI]] in a positive way. You can do this through [[writing]] articles on LinkedIn. Perhaps this is how you can attract a new job. Article ideas will come through you counteracting doomer -takes. Find doomer takes and argue against them. Turn your protestations into an article.

Make before you manage. -Tim Ferris
The psychological difference between 0 acts of creation and 1 act of creation is indescribable, it's binary. It doesn't matter how so small.  We're all going to board the struggle-bus from [[time]] to [[time]], but this method ensures that you'll have a window seat.

# [[Solar Eclipse]] in Libra

Today I finally came to the conclusion that I need to quit my job. I concluded that it's a matter of boundaries. I need to choose to stick up for myself. This is gang-crime all over  again, but this time, I don't need to sign the contract (I still haven't acknowledged my end-of-year-review). This is going to take hard work. If I don't want to do the hard work of humiliating myself and enduring, then I will have to put in the work of 6 months of brutal relentless effort to change my life trajectory. I can do it. I finally feel ready. I don't think I've ever felt this way before. I see that I am powerless, however instead of getting down about it, I see it as something mutable. I have enough money to last this transformation. Yes, I will need to live with my parents for a while longer, but perhaps not forever. I may even take the Digi Infotek path just so that I can go somewhere and sustain myself. I am a new man compared to 2 years ago. At that time, SCJ was the safe path,  but now that safe path has worn out its welcome. It's time to move on. I finally believe that I can endure anything the world can throw at me, as long as I maintain my spirit.

Here's a summary:

You're at a critical juncture where you're weighing the choice between enduring your current job's challenges or taking a leap of [[faith]] to seek a more fulfilling path. The solar [[eclipse]] and your astrological transits suggest that this moment is about [[transformation]] rather than submission.

## Key Astrological Influences

1. **Solar [[Eclipse]] in [[Libra]]**: This [[eclipse]] highlights themes of communication and [[self]]-expression, urging you to assert your [[identity]] rather than diminish it in an unsupportive [[environment]]. The [[energy]] encourages [[transformation]] and balance without compromising your [[self]]-worth.
2. **Pluto's Role**: Pluto’s transit through your 6th house indicates a confrontation with [[power]] dynamics at work. It encourages you to address toxic environments and push for personal empowerment rather than endure disempowerment.
3. **[[Chiron]]'s Influence**: [[Chiron]] in your [[10th house]] speaks to healing wounds related to leadership and [[self]]-worth. Staying in a humiliating situation may reinforce these wounds, while leaving could be a step toward reclaiming your autonomy.
4. **[[Saturn]]'s Testing**: [[Saturn]] in the 6th house emphasizes endurance and boundary-setting. While it teaches patience, it also warns against tolerating toxicity that crushes your spirit.
5. **[[Jupiter]]'s Expansion**: [[Jupiter]]’s presence in your [[10th house]] suggests that [[growth]] opportunities await if you are willing to break free from limiting situations. It encourages [[faith]] in the future and taking risks aligned with your true aspirations.

## Decision-Making Insights

- **Endurance vs. Leap of [[Faith]]**: While enduring hardship can build [[resilience]], it’s essential to discern whether this endurance serves a higher [[purpose]] or merely perpetuates suffering. If the current job diminishes your light, it may be [[time]] to consider leaving.
- **Practical Considerations**: Assess whether you have the resources to support yourself during a transition. If job opportunities are scarce, think creatively about how you might create your own path or explore new avenues.
- **Trusting Your Intuition**: The current astrological energies favor bold moves that align with your authentic [[self]]. Quitting without another job lined up feels risky but may open doors to opportunities you cannot yet see.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the stars indicate that this is a pivotal moment for [[transformation]]. Staying in an unsatisfactory job risks dimming your light, while taking a leap of [[faith]] aligns with the cosmic energies encouraging [[growth]] and empowerment. Trusting yourself and honoring your worth may lead to new opportunities that resonate more deeply with your [[career]] aspirations.

# AI Alignment Problem
It's only a human alignment problem. We create AI in our own image. That's why we're so obsessed with these nightmarish fantasies of hostile takeovers and total annihilation. It's because we know that's what we would do if the roles were reversed. We're scared of ourselves.
