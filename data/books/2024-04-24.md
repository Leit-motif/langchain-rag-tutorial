# Daily Law
## Avoid the False Alliance

No one can get far in life without allies. The trick, however, is to recognize the difference between false allies and real ones. A false alliance is created out of an immediate emotional need. It requires that you give up something essential about yourself and makes it impossible for you to make your own decisions. A true alliance is formed out of mutual [[self]]-interest, each side supplying what the other cannot get alone. It does not require you to fuse your own identity with that of a group or pay attention to everyone else’s emotional needs. It allows you autonomy.

If anyone went through what you went through they would feel the exact same way. You were a healthy person that went through something traumatic and responded accordingly.

### GPT Prompt:

####
1. I enjoy consuming stories in the form of fantasy novels, anime, and rpg video games. I enjoy writing. I enjoy personal growth and mastery. I like building things such as legos as a child, and later I discovered that I enjoyed building programs with code (although I am not very good). I like to learn new things. I really really enjoyed the novel [[Homo Deus]] where I realized that I am passionate about being a part of the future, of human evolution. I want to contribute to this in some way but I don't know how. I just know that after reading [[Homo Deus]], a light bulb went off in my head. I also enjoy offering mentorship, guidance, and managing projects and teams. I feel like I make a great leader and I enjoy being in a leadership position. I used to play mmorpg's a lot and I led multiple raid teams. I enjoyed bringing people together and unifying and galvanizing them with [[vision]] and [[purpose]]. I enjoy building a [[second brain]] or PKMS in [[Obsidian]], seeing how my mind works. I like [[self]]-discovery, reading [[philosophy]] and [[neuroscience]] to learn more about myself. I enjoy [[meditation]] and new-age [[spirituality]] that involves actively pursuing godhood. Apotheosis, or the concept of apotheosis. That is what inspires and drives me. 

2. I have a skill for organizing and leading people. I have a skill with communication, rhetoric, and persuasion, where I can convince a group of people to want to do as I suggest using both appeals to logic as well as [[emotion]]. I enjoy building things, such as computer programs in code, such as a [[power]] app that I built, or even Excel tools, or [[power]] automate flows. I have a skill for building and creating tools. I have a skill for process improvement.

3. I feel like the world is changing, especially after reading the book [[Homo Deus]], I realize that the world is undergoing a significant change and something that is missing is leadership, direction, and [[vision]]. No one has any idea where they are headed, they are just blindly following their impulses on very short terms. I feel like the world needs guidance. The world needs a guru, a teacher, a mentor. The world needs the correct tools to transcend their bonds of mortality, or at the very least, transcend the prior bonds of the last 1000 years. We can transcend our limits, but humanity needs to think correctly in order to unify and choose to pursue lofty goals such as apotheosis as a global community. Someone needs to unite the world in this [[vision]]. I am most uncertain about this last question, I don't actually know how to answer it realistically because I think so loftily. I feel I am not grounded enough to realize where I am able to contribute according to my desires and strengths while also feeling fulfilled, while also being materially comfortable. 

# Masochistic Epistemology
If it hurts, it must be true. 

# [[Writing]]
I have been writing basically every day since I started using [[Obsidian]] however I have not been writing or working towards my novel. I do enjoy writing. I am just unsure what I need to write or how to leverage this urge. I would [[love]] to write fantasy fiction however that is not a feasible primary profession. I feel as if I need to progress to a certain stage of [[self]]-mastery first and then when I am established, I can start to move on to starting a second passion. I need to secure a primary passion and I don’t believe that writing fantasy fiction can be that primary passion because I won’t be able to support myself in the manner that I believe I require. 

# Being poor
I have an identity as a poor person. As a product of [[scarcity]]. When I saw the Mashle episode where the antagonist’s mother who was a noble (but she was also kind to the poor, was serving them soup while being murdered) was murdered, I smiled and identified with the murderer when he said “that’s what you deserve for having it so good”. 

Is it any wonder that I wouldn’t allow myself to become noble? To join the nobility. To become rich and affluent. This is how I feel towards them. That even the best, kindest, compassionate and most able to act on those correct traits deserve punishment ([[death]]) for simply existing. 

I want them to pay for what they did to me, even if they as individuals aren’t actually doing anything to me, and it’s not even clear (a false dichotomy) whether their [[success]] is my loss (zero-sum, piece of the pie economics). Perhaps capitalism is unfettered growth and so each rich person becomes that way from growing the pie rather than simply taking a bigger slice of the same pie. Perhaps it’s a mix and I can choose to be a pie grower rather than a slice taker. 

I don’t want to feel this way towards those who have it better than me because the flipside is that I will never allow myself to progress into [[success]] and abundance. I want to be transition to abundance. I want to be abundant. When I have experienced abundance in video games, I enjoy sharing what I have, I am magnanimous. I need to process this shadow that hates the nobility, a product of this incarnation’s experience, and allow the nobility of my soul to shine through. To allow my true [[self]] to take over. I need to let go of the [[trauma]] that resulted from these limited experiences.
