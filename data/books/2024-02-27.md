# Journal
Yesterday's high was clearly the result of my  interaction with Solitudeblooms on Reddit. When I interact with an understanding girl (or person), Sympatico, I feel whole, complete. I also get complacent, my will to strive diminishes. I choose to actively strive against inertia rather than be lonely and suffer incomplete. 

I will never allow myself to fully turn off again. I must practice temperance. I have learned the need for temperance. I have learned the need for temperance. It would have saved me. My lust clouded my judgement (perhaps). My lust for materialism, my fantasies of living in California surrounded by beautiful, interesting, stimulating people caused me to miss what I had in front of me. It caused me to devalue Victoria as a human being. Although, I see now  that perhaps this ending was inevitable. Still she is playing World of Warcraft, always playing World of Warcraft. If I were to hitch myself to her star, there would be resistance. For her to be attractive to me,  there would be resistance. While it could have all worked out, at what cost? "Virtue is nothing other than right reason."

For me, there is no such  thing as contentedness. There is only despair or elation.
