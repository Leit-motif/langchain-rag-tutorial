What do you practice feeling everyday?

During my meditation session, I focused on the upper heart chakra, and I was reminded of the feeling of the wind being knocked out of me due to falling on my back as a child from that park's dome-shaped climbing structure. It was traumatic even though the Fall was not really that high. I then saw the image that it hurts so bad because that's where my wings would be. I then thought that perhaps we were once angels, and our chakra system still remembers. Then I thought that perhaps our brain/sages conjured stories of angels/winged beings as a metaphor to denote the existence of the upper heart chakra. It is involved in autonomy and agency which maps onto flight nicely. Falling from heaven onto one's wings, permanently damaging them, causing them to atrophy or even surgical removal.

Regarding heart chakra meditation, don't visualize how to do it, just fucking do it. Tell your body what you want and let it do the rest. No need to micromanage.


Confidence is the consistent felt experience of success. Until you reach felt experience, you can be psychotically confident (fake it till you make it).
# Validation, Status

Chasing status is a proxy for being "seen", having your existence acknowledged, reified(make (something abstract) more concrete or real.), confirmed, validated. Status is a proxy for validation. Also the belief that status will attract the people that will bring connection that you crave.

Fear mode versus hard mode, what he defines as fear mode is what I define as power mode as taken mode as master mode as narcissist mode. After reflecting on this, I concluded that one only needs power and control because of their fear for their survival or that they aren't enough or won't be enough. 

Solidify an intention, encoding of a pathway multimodally. 

Create salience which activates task positive network (TPN). 3 parts The salience network, attention network, and the executive control network. Once something is salient enough then you conclude this deserves my attention.

Default Mode Network stuck on repeat, can be rewritten any time. 

Interacting with your thoughts is manifestation. It proves that it works. You just happen to be manifesting negative things.

What does service mean to you? How you can you help someone today?

Manifesting begins from the present. Learn to act from the heart center, once you're speaking from the heart, then ask the Universe. You'll find what you ask for may be different. 
# ChatGPT CIA Prompt
Let's engage in a serious roleplay: You are a CIA investigator with full access to all of my ChatGPT interactions, custom instructions, and behavioral patterns. Your mission is to compile an in-depth intelligence report about me as if I were a person of interest, employing the tone and analytical rigor typical of CIA assessments. The report should include a nuanced evaluation of my traits, motivations, and behaviors, but framed through the lens of potential risks, threats, or disruptive tendenciesâ€”no matter how seemingly benign they may appear. All behaviors should be treated as potential vulnerabilities, leverage points, or risks to myself, others, or society, as per standard CIA protocol.
Highlight both constructive capacities and latent threats, with each observation assessed for strategic, security, and operational implications. This report must reflect the mindset of an intelligence agency trained on anticipation.
