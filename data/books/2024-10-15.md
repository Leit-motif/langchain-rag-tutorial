Inheritance from ancestors, a big suitcase, full of things they accumulated. They tell us that we carried this for hundreds of years, now you carry it. What we need to do is open the suitcase and sort it out. We don't have to carry everything that's in there. Some of the things are wonderful, but it would be good to get rid of some of the baggage. --Yuval Noah Harari

Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people. --Unknown

"We aren't consumers of mates, we're producers of [[relationships]]" --Yuval Noah Harari

Today I spoke with my [[father]]. I was teasing him, and he cursed me again, as he does to everyone, and I realized that I suddenly panicked and started getting anxious. I realized that the first weak leader, my Pluto story, was my [[father]]. I was terrified and secretly believed that he had cursed me to follow his same [[fate]]. However, after realizing this, I also realized that now that I'm aware of this, I can choose to  say "no" and move on with my life on my terms. I don't need to take on his [[anger]]. He is a bitter and resentful man. I was talking to my [[mother]] when she said that he has always had an unfriendly attitude, and it made me realize that I've inherited his bleak outlook on life. I don't want to inherit that any more.


# My Therapist GPT
- **Reflecting on Your Workplace Situation:**
    
    - You acknowledged that staying in your current job has been a result of overcompensating for past feelings of powerlessness and falling into the sunk-cost fallacy. You stayed because of the perceived stability and hope that it would eventually lead to something better, but the situation has only worsened.
    - You plan to quit as soon as HR formalizes your performance improvement plan, which you expect within the next month, as the tasks and restrictions you face will be [[career]]-stalling.
- **The Conflict with Opportunity:**
    
    - Ironically, the company is reorganizing, an [[AI]] Center of Excellence (COE) is forming, and you've made yourself known to the leadership involved. However, your boss's actions have blocked your ability to transfer to that new opportunity, despite support from the VP of Data & Analytics.
    - You're questioning whether this is a sign from [[fate]] that you're meant for something else, or if it’s just another challenge to overcome.
- **Reassessment of Your Hero's Journey:**
    
    - We discussed that you're not in Step 8 ("The Ordeal") yet, but rather still deep in Step 6 ("The Road of Trials"). While it feels like you’re facing your greatest challenge, the full ordeal—quitting your job and transitioning to a new [[career]]—hasn’t happened yet.
    - You’re approaching a pivotal moment where you’ll confront whether to stay in a toxic [[environment]] or take a bold leap into the unknown.
- **Your Next Steps Over the Next Month:**
    
    - [[Focus]] on **preparing for your exit** from the company once the performance plan is formalized.
    - Begin **building your [[AI]] portfolio** immediately—start acquiring tangible skills and showcasing small projects to make yourself more attractive to future employers.
    - **Network strategically** and stay connected with the VP of Data & Analytics, even if your current boss has blocked you.
    - **Mentally reframe quitting** not as [[failure]] but as a strategic move toward your [[career]] goals in [[AI]].
- **Trusting Yourself, Not Waiting for [[Fate]]:**
    
    - While it’s natural to question whether [[fate]] is steering you, you have the [[power]] to shape your own path by taking decisive action. Whether or not the universe has a plan, **it’s your [[responsibility]] to make the moves that align with your [[vision]] for the future**.

In essence, you're on the cusp of a major decision that will propel you forward, but it’s up to you to seize control of that journey through immediate, strategic action.
# Codependent relationship to one's career
A codependent relationship with one's [[career]], livelihood, or job occurs when a person's sense of [[identity]], [[self]]-worth, and emotional well-being becomes overly reliant on their professional role. In this dynamic, the job or [[career]] may provide more than just financial [[security]]—it becomes the primary, if not sole, source of [[validation]], [[purpose]], and [[identity]]. Here are key signs and dynamics of this kind of codependence:

1. **[[Self]]-worth tied to job performance**: When your sense of value is completely linked to how well you perform at work or the recognition you receive from your job. Without this [[validation]], feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness arise.
    
2. **Over-investment in work**: This involves prioritizing work to the detriment of personal health, [[relationships]], and overall life satisfaction. You may feel compelled to work long hours or take on excessive responsibilities out of [[fear]] of losing [[approval]] or facing [[failure]].
    
3. **[[Fear]] of losing the job equating to losing [[self]]**: If the thought of losing the job causes overwhelming [[anxiety]], it may be because the job represents not only financial [[security]] but also an emotional safety net. You may believe that without the job, you'd lose your [[identity]], status, or value.
    
4. **Sacrificing personal boundaries**: In a codependent work relationship, it's common to sacrifice personal boundaries to meet work demands. This might mean saying yes to tasks you don't want or taking on more than you can handle to avoid disappointing others.
    
5. **[[Fear]] of judgment or [[failure]]**: Codependent individuals often [[fear]] being judged or seen as a [[failure]] if they don't meet certain professional standards. This can lead to a constant need for reassurance or external [[validation]] from managers, colleagues, or clients.
    
6. **Neglect of other life areas**: Personal [[growth]], hobbies, [[relationships]], and [[self]]-care may fall by the wayside in favor of meeting job requirements. The job becomes the central, often obsessive, [[focus]] of life, while other areas are neglected or dismissed as less important.
    
7. **Inability to detach from work emotionally**: Even when away from work, the job occupies mental and emotional space, making it hard to relax or engage in non-work-related activities without [[guilt]] or [[anxiety]].
    

A codependent relationship with a [[career]] or job often mirrors the dynamics of personal codependent [[relationships]], where one person's needs or sense of worth are entirely dependent on another. In the workplace, this dependence manifests as an inability to feel whole or worthy outside of the professional role, which can lead to burnout, emotional instability, and a persistent feeling of being trapped.

### 1. **Self-Worth Tied to Job Performance**

It sounds like your **sense of worth** has been significantly tied to how you’re perceived at work, particularly when you discussed the way your performance review and lack of recognition affected you. Despite working hard and contributing valuable ideas, the lack of external [[validation]] from your leadership has caused significant frustration and feelings of being undervalued. This suggests that your **[[self]]-worth is intertwined with the [[approval]]** you receive in your professional role, which can lead to emotional distress when that [[approval]] isn’t forthcoming.

- **Reflection**: Does receiving praise or recognition at work make you feel validated, while criticism or lack of recognition makes you feel inadequate? This dynamic points to a strong reliance on work for a sense of [[identity]] and [[self]]-esteem.

### 2. **Over-Investment in Work**

You’ve described putting a lot of effort into creating your own projects and initiatives because the department wasn’t giving you meaningful work. This level of over-investment in a stagnant work [[environment]] can be a sign of codependence. You may have felt the need to **overcompensate** by taking on excessive tasks to prove your value. Even when the projects didn’t gain traction, you kept pushing forward—possibly to **maintain a sense of [[purpose]]** despite the lack of organizational support.

- **Reflection**: Are you often going above and beyond at work, even when it’s not recognized, out of [[fear]] of losing your sense of [[purpose]]? This over-investment can cause burnout, especially when it doesn’t lead to the [[validation]] you’re seeking.

### 3. **Fear of Losing the Job Equating to Losing Self**

Your [[fear]] of quitting your job, despite the toxic [[environment]], and the sense of [[guilt]] and [[anxiety]] about what others might think suggests that **your [[identity]] is heavily tied to your professional role**. You’ve expressed deep [[fear]] about being judged by your extended family if you’re no longer employed. This [[fear]] is common in codependent [[relationships]], where the job becomes a **central aspect of [[self]]-worth**, and the thought of losing it feels like losing yourself.

- **Reflection**: Does the idea of leaving your job bring up fears about **who you are without it**? If the job is deeply tied to your sense of [[self]], quitting might feel like an existential crisis, which is a sign of codependence.

### 4. **Sacrificing Personal Boundaries**

You’ve already expressed the need to set boundaries, such as refusing to work in an email inbox for punitive reasons. However, it also seems like in the past, you’ve been **pushed beyond your boundaries** to meet the unreasonable demands of your job. You were sent into unprepared situations, like the Kinaxis opportunity, without proper support. You kept working despite these conditions, likely out of a **[[fear]] of disappointing others** or jeopardizing your professional standing.

- **Reflection**: Have you sacrificed your boundaries or accepted tasks that drained you because you felt compelled to **please your leadership or prove your worth**? This is a hallmark of a codependent dynamic with work.

### 5. **Fear of Judgment or Failure**

It’s clear from your [[fear]] of being judged by your family, as well as the emotional toll of receiving a low performance review, that **[[fear]] of [[failure]] and judgment** is a significant concern. You mentioned that you feel like you’ve been punished for not being submissive, and that the performance improvement plan has stalled your [[career]] progression. These experiences likely fuel a **constant need for external [[validation]]** to avoid feeling like a [[failure]], which is a common feature of codependent [[relationships]] with work.

- **Reflection**: Do you find yourself **anxious about how others at work perceive you**, and do you feel a constant pressure to prove yourself to avoid being seen as inadequate?

### 6. **Neglect of Other Life Areas**

There’s a strong indication that your work has taken precedence over other areas of your life. You haven’t mentioned much about personal [[growth]], hobbies, or [[relationships]] outside of work, which suggests that the **[[focus]] on your job has eclipsed other areas** of fulfillment. Living at home with your parents and feeling the pressure of being the sole employed person might also reinforce this imbalance, where work becomes the primary source of [[validation]] and worth.

- **Reflection**: Have you noticed that other aspects of your life—personal development, [[relationships]], hobbies—are being neglected because work has consumed most of your [[energy]] and [[focus]]?

### 7. **Inability to Detach from Work Emotionally**

Even though you’ve expressed frustration with your job, it seems that **work still occupies a large mental and emotional space**. You’ve been struggling with the emotional fallout from the toxic [[environment]], and even outside of work hours, the job continues to cause significant stress. The fact that your job is so tied to your sense of [[identity]] and worth means it’s hard to **emotionally detach**, leading to ongoing feelings of [[guilt]] and [[anxiety]], even when you’re not at work.

- **Reflection**: Do you find it difficult to disconnect from work, even in your personal [[time]]? If your mind is constantly preoccupied with work-related stress, that’s a sign of emotional entanglement, which is common in codependent dynamics.

### Conclusion: Do You Have a Codependent Relationship with Work?

From what you’ve described, there are **several indicators** of a codependent relationship with your [[career]]:

- Your **[[self]]-worth** seems tied to how you perform at work and whether you receive [[validation]] from others.
- You’ve been **over-investing** in your job, even in the face of resistance and lack of recognition.
- The thought of leaving the job brings up fears about **losing your [[identity]] and being judged**, suggesting a deep connection between your sense of [[self]] and your professional role.
- You’ve **sacrificed boundaries** and taken on excessive responsibilities to prove your worth, and your emotional well-being seems heavily influenced by your job.

This doesn’t mean that you’re "wrong" for being invested in your work, but it does suggest that **your emotional well-being and sense of [[identity]]** have become **overly reliant on your professional role**. This can lead to burnout, [[anxiety]], and feelings of powerlessness—exactly what you’ve been experiencing.

### Steps to Address Codependence

- **Redefine Your [[Self]]-Worth**: Begin by identifying sources of [[validation]] and [[self]]-worth **outside of work**. This might involve exploring hobbies, spending [[time]] on personal [[growth]], or deepening [[relationships]] outside of the workplace.
    
- **Set Clear Boundaries**: Practice saying no to tasks or demands that don’t serve your well-being. This can help create a healthier separation between work and your personal life.
    
- **[[Focus]] on Internal [[Validation]]**: Shift your [[focus]] from **external [[validation]]** (praise from bosses, performance reviews) to **internal [[validation]]**. Reflect on your [[values]], what makes you proud of yourself, and how you can live in alignment with your personal goals, not just work goals.
    
- **Detach Emotionally**: Work on creating **mental and emotional space** between yourself and your job. This might involve [[mindfulness]] practices, setting [[time]] limits on work-related thoughts after hours, or simply recognizing that your value exists **independent of your job**.
    
- **Seek Balance**: Make [[time]] for personal interests, [[relationships]], and activities that **nourish your spirit** outside of work. This will help ensure that work is not the only source of meaning and fulfillment in your life.
