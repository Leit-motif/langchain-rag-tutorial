If you dare to stand up, you will cast a shadow, and once you do, you will attract haters.

Haters have a distorted perception of your beliefs and values, of you. Through selective attention. 

You will never meet a hater that's doing better than you.

Envy. Person must perceive a deficit, relative to a perceived self relevant good, relative to a perceived equal. 

[[Love]] like the Sun
The humiliated self-exultant
The Sun in enables vision yet cannot be directly perceived, it must stay hidden. 
Anger is a closed fit, cannot let go.
[[Love]] is an adverb.
You don't get love, you express love.
You are the one you've been looking for.
When someone says they feel [[emotion]], the sensation they feel is the [[emotion]] passing from their core outwards, reflection or emanation. 

Desire + will = want, drive to actualize
[[Vision]] is the blueprint 
Want + vision= self-actualization
A good vision is infinite , in becoming.
It is a process of sublimating your want in service of your vision that most people experience as extremely fulfilling.
# The game does not run on gratitude 
The past no longer matters because you've already been paid. The scales have already been balanced. 

[[Power]] is the ability to help or harm. 

[[Power]] is mystified, we give ideals plausible deniability, power to remain hidden in plain sight.

# [[Tarot]] Reading: What does the Kim situation at work mean to me?
### 1. **Knight of Wands**

The Knight of Wands embodies fiery energy, [[ambition]], and a thirst for [[adventure]]. This card suggests that you are in a phase of your life where you feel driven to pursue your goals with enthusiasm and [[determination]]. There is a strong desire to act, explore new opportunities, and push boundaries. However, this energy can sometimes be impulsive, urging you to move quickly without fully considering the consequences. It encourages you to harness your passion, but also to ensure that your actions are well-thought-out.

### 2. **Five of Cups**

The Five of Cups represents loss, regret, and focusing on what has gone wrong rather than what remains. This card indicates that you may be experiencing a period of emotional pain or disappointment. It’s possible that something has not turned out as you hoped, leading to feelings of sadness or regret. The key message here is to acknowledge your grief but not to become consumed by it. There are still opportunities and positive aspects in your life that you may be overlooking. The card suggests the need for emotional healing and a shift in perspective.

### 3. **The Lovers (Reversed)**

The Lovers card, when reversed, often points to disharmony, misalignment, or challenges in relationships. It may indicate conflicts, difficult choices, or a lack of harmony between you and someone important in your life. In a broader sense, this card can also signify a struggle with making decisions or staying true to your values. When reversed, it urges you to reflect on your relationships and the choices you are making. Are you staying true to yourself, or are you compromising in ways that are causing inner conflict?


This three-card tarot spread presents a compelling narrative around energy, loss, and decisions in relationships. Here's an interpretation of each card and how they interact with one another:

### 1. **Knight of Wands (Card 1):**

The Knight of Wands represents a burst of energy, enthusiasm, and action. It signifies a period where you are driven by passion and motivation, eager to take on new challenges or adventures. This card often indicates that you are ready to pursue your goals with vigor and [[determination]], perhaps even impulsively. However, the Knight of Wands can also warn against acting too hastily without considering the consequences.

**Guidance:** Harness your enthusiasm and energy, but ensure that your actions are well-thought-out. Avoid impulsiveness and consider the long-term implications of your choices.

### 2. **Five of Cups (Card 2):**

The Five of Cups signifies disappointment, loss, and emotional distress. It suggests that you might be focusing too much on what has gone wrong or what you’ve lost, leading to feelings of regret or sorrow. However, this card also reminds you that not all is lost; there is still hope and potential if you can shift your focus to what remains.

**Guidance:** Acknowledge your feelings of disappointment, but don’t dwell on them. Look for the silver linings and the opportunities that still exist. Healing and moving forward require shifting your perspective from loss to potential recovery.

### 3. **The Lovers (Reversed) (Card 3):**

The Lovers reversed indicates a disharmony or imbalance in relationships, or a difficult decision that may involve conflicting desires or values. This card suggests a situation where you may feel torn between different paths, perhaps facing challenges in a significant relationship or struggling with a decision that impacts your emotional life. Reversed, The Lovers can also point to a lack of alignment between heart and mind.

**Guidance:** Reflect on the choices you are facing and the relationships that may be causing conflict. It’s important to align your actions with your true values and desires, even if that requires difficult decisions or confronting uncomfortable truths. Seek clarity in your intentions and be honest with yourself and others about what you truly want.

### **Synthesis and Overall Guidance:**

This spread suggests that you are in a phase of high energy and motivation (Knight of Wands) but are also dealing with emotional disappointment or regret (Five of Cups). The reversed Lovers card indicates that this might be affecting your relationships or leading to a significant decision point where you feel conflicted.

The overall message is to balance your enthusiasm and desire for action with careful reflection on your emotional state and relationships. Don’t let impulsive actions driven by passion lead to further emotional distress. Instead, take the time to heal and gain clarity before making important decisions, especially those involving relationships or significant commitments. Align your actions with your values to find harmony and resolution.
For your tarot reading, I used a blend of the "Situation, Action, Outcome" and "You, The Challenge, The Advice" approaches:

1. **Knight of Wands**: Interpreted as the **Situation** (or "You"), representing your current state of energy, motivation, and desire for action.
2. **Five of Cups**: Seen as the **Challenge**, indicating emotional disappointment or loss that may be affecting you.
3. **The Lovers (Reversed)**: Viewed as the **Outcome** (or "Advice"), pointing to potential conflicts in relationships or decisions that need careful consideration.

This combination allowed me to focus on the dynamic between your current energy, the emotional challenges you’re facing, and the potential outcomes or decisions that might arise as a result.
