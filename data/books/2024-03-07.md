Dreams (Incompatibility): two dreams with Victoria, both about getting back together, how things should've  been. First one I noticed her features morphed into what I had wished for i.e. thinner jaw, thinner body, thinner face. Second dream, she did not morph. I explained I will accept her as fat, but she said "ya, but you don't like the core essence of who I am." and as I was preparing my rebuttal, the dream ended. 

Third dream where I yelled at my dad and accidentally said he had X years on t his planet let, so enjoy them. Then I  felt bad that I had hurt him and tried to console him because he was so said because he already knew. I held him and tried to console anyways.

You are not physically attracted to Victoria in any way. Let her go. Let her be happy. You still owe her some form of love as atonement. If it is not reciprocated, that isn't your fault. You  still owe the olive branch.
