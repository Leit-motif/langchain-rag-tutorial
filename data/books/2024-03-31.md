# Daily [[Gratitude]]

# [[Self]]-[[acceptance]]
[[Acceptance]], [[Beauty]]
I won't accept myself, my appearance, until I look like how I'm supposed to look, without this draping, coat, later of fat occluding me. ^6eb99d

# [[Acceptance]]
[[Acceptance]], [[Compassion]], [[Fate]]
My mom bought me a clothing rack and a mirror for my room downstairs. I initially reacted angrily telling my mom that what I had asked for was a solution to the freezing temperatures downstairs. I chastised her telling her that I only want things that I've actually asked for. She reacted placatingly, stammering and making excuses that solving the heating problem is too complex, which I interpreted as Kicking the Can down the road. It made me angry because I have endured this pattern my entire life. It feels as if my needs are nota priority or surely they would be spurned to act. Instead, they wait it out, meaning I endure. Things never change. After I reacted in [[anger]], I felt guilty. I realized that getting angry does nothing, it only causes more [[pain]]. What if they are truly incapable of doing more, of trying harder, what if this truly is the best they have? That would mean I am needlessly torturing them. Being Compassionate means I need to meet and accept people where they are, not where I want or need them to be. 

It sucks to accept that I won't get the support that I need, but whether I accept it or not, it's not like the outcome would change. It's funny that there’s a part of me that thinks that by not accepting circumstances, that somehow gives me control, whereas, in [[truth]] the only modicum of control I can exert is my acknowledging and accepting events as they are. [[Acceptance]] is my only shot at agency. Denying [[fate]] only affords me the opportunity of creating new [[pain]] which has its own repercussions, it's own cause and effect timelines. The timeline I initially protested remains unaffected.

I chose compassion, apologized to my mother and thanked her for what She was able to afford. I have closed that timeline, I have not Kept it alive,  revived it as [[pain]] timeline a [[pain]] Loop.

# Mercury Retrograde April 2024
## [[Trust]], surrender, and the 
[[Fate]] | [[Time]] | [[Trust]]
[[Trust]] that things in the past happened the way they were meant to. Don't get stuck in [[regret]]. You'll get stuck, what's done is done. Eclipse coming, your future needs you. 

## Retrograde Energy 
[[Growth]] | [[Time]]
Directs you to look to the past. The trick is to look at who you were in the past as a way to reflect on your journey.

# [[Scarcity]] Mindset
[[Scarcity]]
I [[love]] this Dexnor keyboard. I can type on my lap on the couch. That alone makes it worth it. The [[purpose]] of this purchase was to get me away from my desk. I am sick of worrying so much about money to the point where I can't be happy with a purchase unless I have gotten it at a significant discount. This is the legacy of my upbringing in borderline-poverty. It also has to do with the financial literacy and strategy of my parents which is heavily biased to [[scarcity]] vs abundance. As I write this, I realize It was likely adaptive and necessary. I come from a people of [[scarcity]]. It may even be epigenetic.

# [[Purpose]] and the [[Daemon]]
[[Purpose]], [[Acceptance]]
![[How to Find a [[Purpose]] and the [[Psychology]] of the [[Daemon]]#^d3231492]]

I am going through this right now. I am currently working in a job that I am not called to. Others can tell. I have not accepted it and I don’t think I’m capable of accepting it. I feel as if others (such as Caitlin) may feel that I am entitled, or that I am being indulgent in thinking that I deserve to like what I do. I should be thankful that I have a relatively easy job that pays me a moderate sum for doing essentially nothing. I should be thankful for what I have been given and be a good little boy. But I’m not. I’m insubordinate and it shows. I have created ill will in others and it is because I am not happy where I am. I don’t belong. There is dissonance between me and my [[environment]]. 

Now, I have also been offered another position as a data engineer. A way forward along this path of … uncalling. This path of telling. I am being told by my [[environment]] what I should do. I am being told by the whims of [[fate]] what I should humbly accept. Yet I do not feel called to wrestling with SQL for the next X years. I do see it as the first step in the path of eventually working with machine learning and generative ai, however I do not feel nearly as called in this direction as I would be tethered to SCJ, to Racine WI, and I do not feel nearly as inspired as I do towards writing, for which I truly to feel called. 

However, I understand that it is unlikely that I will be afforded the hospitality by [[fate]] to write unmolested. Therefore I need to find a job that doesn’t drain me, that is neutral or even uplifts me, so that I can write when I get home. I need space. Therefore at this time, I feel that in my immediate surrounding, based on what I know, I do not want a job that cognitively strains me during the day so that I have nothing left in the evening. This appears to me to be a job that is project management or consultant oriented.
