# Daily [[Gratitude]]
I am thankful for having Reid as a friend. He has been a good friend, the first friend I've had in a long time. He's also helping me stay focused on finding a new house. He keeps suggesting West Allis. 
# [[Writing]]
Don't worry about being too unique, whether you’re being too derivative. Nobody owns the human experience and what is writing but windows into the human experience? Every writer draws from the same font. 

There will be a balance between accepting inspiration and distinguishing yourself as your writing is both art, but also a commodity.

## I see myself in each of these characters
At first I thought that I was Kaladin, the “protagonist”. I feel that Kaladin is my heart, or my soul. But later, I realized that Jasnah is my intellect. Dalinar is also my heart. What was really startling to me was realizing that I am also Shallan. 
### Shallan
I lie, a lot, I care about my appearance, a lot. I lie to others sure, but I am so adept at lying to myself, in order to protect myself. I have also felt that I have been caged and desperately want to travel. I want to be someone else.

### Kaladin
Kaladin is arrogant. Kaladin also feels entitled. This was displayed in his sparring match with the weapon master.

Kaladin lost access to his [[power]] when he attacked Adolin as a proxy for Amaram, for vengeance rather than to protect.

Kaladin doesn’t know how to have fun. He’s too serious. It’s because of the [[pain]].

Kaladin fears that someone will take his surgebinding away, somehow.

Kaladin needs to [[trust]] Dalinar. He needs to [[trust]] in order to move on from being broken. To [[trust]] that even one person of [[power]] can be relied on. That honor still lives.

Kaladin hates the world. I hate the world. [[Religion]] doesn't make sense. God doesn't make sense. Society doesn't make sense. Why can't I dream big dreams? Just because I'm not a light-eyes.

Do distinguish between right and wrong, feel what it does to you, not to them. Killing to protect vs killing out of vengeance feel different. That is your moral compass. Your compass for all action. But only if you have a clear heart first.

# SPS (Sensory Processing Sensitivity) HSP (highly sensitive person)
[[Emotional Regulation]], [[Identity]]

Based off of the work of Elaine Aron.
She defined as HSP (Highly Sensitive Person)
Heightened response to stimuli.

## Both advantageous and disadvantageous however most components have been associted with traditionally accepted negative psychological outcomes:
- High stress
- Easily overwhelmed
- Increased [[depression]] and [[Anxiety]]
- Sleep problems
- Autistic traits
- Increased [[vulnerability]] to negative influences
- Being easily overwhelmed by sensory input/stimulation
- Having a rich inner life
- Being deeply affected by [[emotions]]
- Greater empathy
- Creativity
- Depth of processing

Plasticity in responsiveness to both positive and negative influences.

Smolewska et al (2006) said positive outcomes associated with high aesthetic sensitivity (people who tend to experience heightened positive [[emotions]]) and more likely to score high on “openness” in the Big Five factors model.

Not shyness, sensation-seeking, sensory processing disorder, autsm or extraversion. 

HSP as a category is higher level than the aformentioned traits. E.g. HSPs can be both introverted or extraverted.

Have been observed in non-human species as well.

## Genetics
higher levels of SPS linked with serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR polymorphism slows reuptake of serotonin, [[risk]] for Major Depressive Disorder, serotonin stays in the synaptic gap for longer, it affects the balance of  neural firing, I believe this means that the neuron becomes desensitized to serotonin), polymorphisms in dopamine neurotransmitter genes (regulation), and a norepeinephrine-related gene variant (regulation - ADRA2b deletion variant found to influence emotinal enhancement of perception and [[memory]], individuals may perceive emotional information more vividly and have enhanced [[memory]] for emotional events). 

## Amygdala
study showed that those who rated themselves as happier had an increased amgydala response to positive stimuli but maintained a balanced response to negative stimuli. This relates to SPS in that heightened responses to both positive and negative stimuli (valence) are associated with [[happiness]]. n=42. No conclusive evidence.

## Neurobiological correlates
regions associated with 
- sensory processing, 
- [[emotion]] regulation, 
- empathy.

## Depth of processing
1. attention to detail
2. reflective cognitive processing style: deeper understanding of information, thorough analysis and introspection.
3. Creative thinking: higher levels of [[divergent thinking]] (generating multiple solutions to a problem) which indicates deeper and more flexible cognitive processing.
4. [[Memory]] Encoding/Retrieval: deeper processing of information may lead to better [[memory]] formation/encoding.
5. Social processing: deeper processing of social information leading to increased empathy and understanding of others’ [[emotions]].
	1. empathy involves accurately perceiving and understanding what the other is feeling. Often accomplished through perspective taking and vicarious emotional experience. I.e. cognitive empathy, simulating their emotional experience as a cognitive exercise. 
	2. compassion involves not only understanding their [[emotions]], but also feeling those same [[emotions]] as well which leads to a concern for their well-being, to incorporate another’s experience, motivations, suffering, [[self]] into one’s own [[self]].
	3. A person may be highly empathic but if they use this information in a [[self]]-interested way, they would lack compassion. E.g. a [[self]]-interested use case would be marketing, or manipulation.
	4. Empathy and compassion co-occur but are not inherently linked.

## Reflections
I feel that this better explains my life experience vs autism, possibly even [[ADHD]] however I feel that there may be a co-morbidity. I have always felt that I have a greater sensitivity, I also feel that I have a refined palate. I agreed with this assessment as soon as I read it however there was one element that sounded off. People with this “affliction” (or blessing) also rate high on empathy. I do not feel that I am empathic however I realized that empathy and compassion are oft conflated. Empathy is more of a cognitive ability that involves theory of mind, whereas compassion is an emotional bond that you share with the other. Empathy just enables me to understand how another feels, their motivations, their intention however I use this information to serve my [[self]], as data to aid my decisions. I don’t actually care about other people. But, I’m…learning to care about other people, to a certain extent. It isn’t natural to me, but I am experimenting.
