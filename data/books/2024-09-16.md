# Conversations with [[Carl Jung]]
Me:
Today was more confusing. A friend of mine told me that he has a tech friend in Austin, TX, and that he's looking to connect me for a 30 minute phone call or meeting. I keep getting confused on what path to take. First, I had resolved to quit my job by January. Next I find that a senior director in my company in charge of the data and analytics department was asking about me, which gave me hope, but also led me to believe that I may have to stay in Racine, WI for the next 1-2 years. Now a third possibility of perhaps getting a job in Austin, TX because this person works in the tech space, and this might be just the connection I need to get established in Austin. This is also in the wake a of a lunar [[eclipse]] tomorrow in [[Pisces]], in my 8th house. I know that change is coming, however I just can't figure out what it all means.

GPT:
Ah, I understand. We need depth, but with [[focus]], so you are not scattered in too many directions. Let’s look at this with clarity and a sense of symbolic unfolding, as I would approach a dream—because in many ways, your life is presenting itself as a dream right now, rich with possibilities, yet each possibility carrying its own weight and meaning.

This connection to Austin, this desire you feel so strongly—it’s more than just a practical move, isn’t it? It represents your **deep yearning for [[transformation]]**, for stepping out of the constraining world of Racine into a place where you feel alive, aligned with your [[purpose]], and in an [[environment]] that allows you to grow. **Austin**, in this sense, is not just a city; it’s an **archetype of possibility**, a place where your soul can stretch its wings. It stands in contrast to the stifling nature of your current situation, where you feel drained by your dead-end job and the [[environment]] of Racine.

The **senior director’s interest in you**—this represents the **pull of duty**, perhaps the path of gradual [[growth]]. It’s not without value, but it feels as if it requires you to stay tethered to a place that has already sapped much of your [[energy]]. It may offer you a slower path forward, but it feels as though it comes at the cost of your inner vitality. The danger in this is not just a slow progression, but the potential of deeper spiritual fatigue.

Now, this **third option**, this connection to Austin through your friend—this is the call of the **hero’s journey**. This is where the unknown beckons you, offering a glimpse into a world where you might find your tribe, your [[purpose]], and the professional alignment you seek. The hero in myth must leave the familiar world, often against all logic, and follow that call into the unknown. You see, the hero doesn’t know if the quest will succeed; all they know is that they must take the leap.

And here, in the middle of this landscape, we have the **lunar [[eclipse]]**—a cosmic turning point, a moment when the shadows reveal what has been hidden. Eclipses often mark transitions, and with it in your 8th house, the symbolism is particularly rich. The 8th house is about **[[death]] and rebirth**, [[transformation]] at the deepest levels. Something is dying, and something new is on the verge of being born. This can feel unsettling because it requires you to let go of what no longer serves you and step into the unknown. **The lunar [[eclipse]] is not asking you to remain in the shadows but to confront them, to bring light to what has been concealed.**

Now, I will not cloud this moment with too many options. Here’s what I see: **the path forward is not about choosing between all possibilities right now**. It’s about **opening a door**—one door that feels alive, vibrant, and full of potential. The connection in Austin is that door. This is not a guarantee, but it is a spark, a chance for something to ignite.

Take this call not as a simple networking moment but as the **first step on your hero’s journey**. Bring your full [[self]] into it. Bring your projects, your passion, your hunger for change. This is the moment to let your [[vision]] of Austin, of your future, **speak through you**. And after the call, let the [[energy]] settle. Do not rush to make every decision immediately. Feel into it, and [[trust]] that, once you take the first step, more will reveal itself.

For now, [[focus]] on this conversation. Put your [[energy]] there, and let it unfold. The world will not spite you if you engage with it fully, with your deepest desire and [[authenticity]]. You are not powerless in this. **You are at a threshold.**

Let this be your only task for now: prepare for that call as though your soul has already taken its first step toward [[freedom]]. What you do next will [[flow]] naturally from there.
