I'm starting to get fleeting visions that elicit extreme excitement. It involves a fantasy where I'm able to make something happen, through the [[power]] of manipulation, or seduction, or the [[power]] of my actions. It's the ability to make something happen in a vacuum. To create for myself, the nourishment that I desperately crave. The two fantasies are the [[power]] to create my own income through becoming an entrepreneur, literally creating my livelihood, my [[financial freedom]], from scratch. To be independent, to not be dependent on terrible jobs, chance, the world which has nothing for me, and for which I have nothing for them. The ability to create my [[freedom]] instead of lamenting my chains. The second fantasy involves having the [[power]] of seduction to overcome women's initial repulsion to me. It's not to say that I am repulsive, however their standards are such that there will naturally be a resistance to me because I don't have the status, looks, and money yet. While I work on these, I am titillated by the idea that I can immediately disarm any resistance from any woman I'm attracted to. Any person I'm attracted to. If I believe myself to be inherently cursed, to be inherently disadvantaged, then there's nothing I can do about it. There's no crying over spilled milk, however, what if I had the [[power]] to transcend my limitations entirely, by changing the nature of the game entirely. The Universe seeks to consume me entropy, to snuff me out, however what if I was able to shine so bright as to blot out all void in my life? What if I counteract the entropy a thousand fold? Why do I believe that I can't do that? The things I want at this stage in my life aren't exceedingly uncommon, they aren't impossible, they don't cost exorbitant amounts of money (yet). Instead of the path of have vs have not, what about a third way? The z-axis.

# [[Procrastination]]

# [[Amour-propre]]




## GPT 1
I am asking for your help to figure out the answer to this question. I feel as if I and my [[father]] have been driven by a massively inflame [[amour-propre]], perhaps we are sensitive to the inflammation of armour-propre, however I realize within myself, that it has driven me to act, or escape into a fantasy world due to the [[pain]] and tension it creates.

This sensitivity to inflamed _amour-propre_—and the subsequent urge to escape—suggests an intense internal struggle. Rousseau’s concept implies that _amour-propre,_ when inflamed, can make the [[self]] painfully reactive to perceived comparisons, inadequacies, or judgments. For you, this likely exacerbates a push-pull between the desire to excel or gain recognition and a deep dissatisfaction with how these efforts may not satisfy the true [[self]].

In seeking to escape into fantasy, you might be trying to find relief from this inner conflict by immersing in a world that doesn’t demand constant [[validation]] or expose you to the judgments of others. Fantasy worlds can offer a way to momentarily satisfy _amour-propre_ on terms that feel controlled and free of harsh comparisons.

To start unpacking this further, let’s consider: when you think about moments in your life where this inflamed _amour-propre_ felt most painful, were they tied to specific social or familial contexts, or more internalized, linked to personal standards and ambitions?

it's not just "moments", it's every moment. I have no escape from this tyranny. I wish to escape every moment in some way. I have purified myself of the most egregious forms of [[escapism]], however there are still some that remain, such as tasty food (which gets in the way of my fitness goals) and watching anime or youtube (which gets in the way of my [[career]] goals). Due to the emotional tax, I don't have [[energy]] remaining to create the [[environment]] with which I can free myself from my current prison of a life, a life I don't want, where I'm unfulfilled. However, now that I write this out, I think my crippling unfulfillment may be driven more so by [[amour-propre]] rather than [[amour de soi]]. Inflamed [[amour-propre]] is most painful from the point of view of [[career]], status, recognition, and the [[power]] that that would entail. I want the [[freedom]] to live where I want, how I want, with whom I want. I have determined that the only way to get that [[freedom]] is through money. I believe the best way to get money and all the other things/[[relationships]] I want out of life is through status and recognition, or rather, that status and recognition are the signifier 
that I am doing what I must to meet my needs.

Your recognition of how _amour-propre_ drives both the [[pain]] of your current life and the means you feel are necessary to escape it—namely, status and recognition—shows a keen awareness of the paradox at play. Rousseau would likely view this as a trap many people find themselves in: the belief that only external achievements (status, [[wealth]]) will bring [[freedom]], while those very pursuits intensify the dependency on outside [[validation]]. It’s as if the more one chases these symbols of [[freedom]], the more captive one feels to the expectations of others and the tension of unfulfilled _amour-propre._

Given that _amour-propre_ has, for you, embedded itself in every moment and nearly every pursuit, the root issue may lie in disentangling [[self]]-worth from external markers—no small task. The path to more intrinsic fulfillment (_amour de soi_) would entail reorienting your goals and motivations toward genuine [[self]]-appreciation and autonomy, independent of outside [[validation]]. In practical terms, this could mean gradually redefining [[success]] not in terms of recognition, but in terms of alignment with [[values]], small wins, or even daily experiences that make life feel more authentically rewarding.

How do you feel about exploring goals or ambitions rooted in _amour de soi_? These might look different than the status-driven ones but can be meaningful and help ease the pull toward [[escapism]].

Your approach—to harness AP rather than eliminate it—aligns with Rousseau’s more complex view of AP as a dual force that, when channeled well, can inspire humanity’s greatest achievements, while unrestrained, it can lead to destructive [[pride]] or alienation. Properly harnessed, AP can indeed be a source of creative drive, [[resilience]], and innovation. The goal, then, is to channel AP so that it fuels progress and achievement without leaving you dependent on external [[validation]].

To harness AP effectively, consider these points:

1. **Anchor AP in [[Values]], Not [[Validation]]**: Instead of seeking status for its own sake, which can be fleeting, aim for achievements that resonate with your deeper [[values]] or life [[purpose]]. If AP is tied to something meaningful to you personally, its fulfillment feels more enduring and satisfying.
    
2. **Balance Competitive Drive with Personal Standards**: AP often thrives on competition, so try setting personal benchmarks or “friendly competitions” with yourself, rather than with others. This way, you stay motivated to improve without the burnout of constant comparison.
    
3. **Transform Recognition into [[Responsibility]]**: Rousseau saw the wise man as someone who seeks esteem but only from those whose judgment he respects. You might explore who, in your life or field, represents the [[values]] you respect and whose recognition would actually inspire you to grow meaningfully, not just inflate your ego.
    
4. **Use AP to Fuel Skill Mastery and Depth**: Achievements that are AP-driven yet centered on deepening your expertise (such as through continuous learning or creative mastery) allow AP to support genuine fulfillment. This way, recognition becomes a natural byproduct of excellence.
    

With these strategies, AP becomes a tool, one that helps align your goals with both personal fulfillment and external achievement, maximizing the best parts of both worlds. Does this approach resonate with how you envision using AP to propel yourself forward?
## GPT 2
In this conversation, we explored how Rousseau’s concept of inflamed _amour-propre_ ([[self]]-[[love]] distorted by external [[validation]]) relates to my inner dynamics. Key insights emerged:

1. **External [[Validation]] and [[Self]]-Worth**: My [[self]]-evaluation is often tied to outcomes, particularly in [[career]] and intellectual accomplishments. This drive reflects a need for external recognition, amplified by an underlying [[fear]] of stagnation or mediocrity. This aligns with _amour-propre_ when it becomes a competitive quest for superiority rather than a balanced [[self]]-assessment.
    
2. **Intellectual Isolation as [[Self]]-Defense**: My intellectual pursuits may serve as a shield, preventing [[vulnerability]] by setting me apart. This isolation could protect against situations that might expose inadequacies, while also reinforcing [[loneliness]]—a tension Rousseau warned would arise from inflated [[self]]-[[love]] tied to social comparison.
    
3. **Existential Tension**: The struggle between autonomy and societal or familial expectations mirrors Rousseau’s view that inflamed _amour-propre_ distances individuals from their natural selves. This tension is exacerbated by cultural and familial pressures, complicating my quest for [[self]]-defined [[purpose]].
    
4. **[[Identity]] Formation and [[Fear]] of Inadequacy**: My high standards for [[success]] create cycles of [[self]]-[[doubt]] and frustration when unmet. There is a deep connection between perceived achievement and [[self]]-worth, informed by a [[fear]] of replicating familial shortcomings. This fixation reflects _amour-propre_'s [[vulnerability]] to [[self]]-image and comparison.
    
5. **[[Emotional Regulation]] and Control**: My somatic practices help regulate [[emotions]] but may also function as ways to maintain control rather than allowing [[vulnerability]]. This resonates with _amour-propre_'s [[discomfort]] with openness and reliance on external reinforcement for stability.
    
6. **Superiority and Isolation**: Oscillating between a sense of superiority and isolation reflects an internalized narrative that separates me from others, reinforcing both intellectual [[pride]] and [[loneliness]]. Rousseau would see this as an unfortunate consequence of inflamed _amour-propre_, limiting empathy and equality.
    

**Conclusion**: My journey toward [[self]]-actualization might benefit from cultivating a form of [[self]]-worth less dependent on external [[validation]], focusing on intrinsic value. This could involve embracing [[vulnerability]], [[uncertainty]], and [[failure]] without attaching my [[self]]-worth to outcomes, fostering a more compassionate, integrated sense of [[self]].
