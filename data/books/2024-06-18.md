# Daily Law
## The Seductive Visuals

> The people are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things.

When the con artist Yellow Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was peddling, he called it the “Red Letter Newsletter” and had it printed, at considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency, [[power]], and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to [[deception]]—as do modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use “gold” in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold. Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to the word.

> Daily Law: Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color have enormous symbolic resonance.
