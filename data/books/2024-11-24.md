## Response
### **1. 4 of Cups (Current Position/Environment)**

The **4 of Cups** represents dissatisfaction, stagnation, and the feeling of being emotionally disconnected. It suggests that your current role has left you feeling unfulfilled, despite potential opportunities or offers. You may be so focused on what isnâ€™t working that itâ€™s hard to see the possibilities still available. This card mirrors the toxic environment and lack of alignment with your aspirations that youâ€™ve described.

**Reflection:**

- Are there untapped opportunities in your current role that youâ€™ve overlooked or dismissed because of frustration?

Whether this new start involves staying and transitioning within SCJ or starting over elsewhere, the card emphasizes that your decision should be guided by what fills your heart with purpose and joy.

**Reflection:**

- Are you prepared to take the emotional risks needed to pursue your aspirations fully?
- What opportunities (like the AI Center of Excellence) could reignite your creative and professional energy, and are they worth waiting for?
- What role does emotional balance play in your decision-making process?

### **3. 6 of Swords (The Call to Transition)**

The **6 of Swords** remains a powerful card of transition and leaving behind challenges to seek calmer, more promising waters. It suggests that moving forwardâ€”whether by pivoting roles within SCJ or stepping away entirelyâ€”is key to breaking free from stagnation. This card often comes with a sense of bittersweetness, acknowledging that leaving behind whatâ€™s familiar can be difficult, even when itâ€™s necessary for growth.

**Reflection:**

- Are you ready to leave behind the toxicity and frustrations of your current environment, even if it means venturing into the unknown?
- How can you ensure that any transition you make aligns with your long-term vision and emotional well-being?

### **Integrating the Spread: Key Themes**

The revised spread paints a picture of dissatisfaction with the present (**4 of Cups**), hope and inspiration for the future (**Ace of Cups**), and a clear call to transition (**6 of Swords**). Together, the cards suggest that youâ€™re at a crossroads where you must weigh the potential benefits of staying (with the possibility of eventual growth) against the emotional cost of enduring stagnation and toxicity.

### **Practical Guidance for Your Decision**

#### **If You Stay (Committing to SCJ for 90 Days):**

- Use the 90 days strategically to position yourself for future success, even if it feels uninspiring in the moment (**4 of Cups**).
- Focus on the potential renewal offered by the AI Center of Excellence (**Ace of Cups**).
- Make sure to set boundaries to protect your emotional well-being as you navigate the challenges of the toxic environment.

**Action Plan:**

1. Leverage the time to build relationships with supportive leaders and work on AI-related skills.

Your career journey reflects a mix of technical expertise, personal growth, and a drive for innovation. You have a background in psychology with a focus on cognitive science, but your career path has led you into roles emphasizing data analysis, project management, and automation. Youâ€™ve cultivated strong skills in tools like Power BI, Power Automate, and Python, and have experience in leading projects using Lean Six Sigma and Agile methodologies. However, youâ€™ve felt a disconnect between your current role and your aspirations in AI and tech innovation.

Currently, you work as a Domain Data Steward at SC Johnson, where you manage operational support for systems like Winshuttle and lead Agile ceremonies for localization projects. Despite this, your job feels stagnant and unaligned with your long-term goals. Youâ€™ve faced challenges, including a toxic work environment, limited opportunities for growth, and resistance from your manager, which has blocked your attempts to transfer to more relevant roles.

Youâ€™re navigating these frustrations while building connections with leadership, like a VP of Data and Analytics, who has expressed interest in helping you transition. Meanwhile, SCJ is developing an AI Center of Excellence, presenting potential future opportunities. Youâ€™re also exploring entrepreneurship and envision a career pivot toward AI product management, with a plan to progress through roles like data analyst and data scientist to build experience.

Recently, youâ€™ve decided to endure a 90-day trial of menial tasks at SCJ, knowing it may lead to a transfer into the AI department, a junior AI engineer role, and a clearer path toward your goals. This compromise aligns with your larger vision of contributing to AI innovation and achieving personal and professional independence.

Hmm, I want you to expand upon what happened from a narrative perspective regarding my journey at SCJ.

###### ChatGPT said:

Your journey at SC Johnson has been one of aspiration, resilience, and a clash between personal ambition and institutional limitations. When you joined SCJ, you likely saw potential in the roleâ€”not necessarily as an end goal, but as a stepping stone toward your broader vision of entering the AI and tech industries. You applied your skills effectively, managing data-related projects and leading Agile teams, which showcased your ability to work strategically and innovate within the constraints of your position. Early on, you likely built a reputation as someone with potential for leadership and technical advancement.

However, as time passed, the limitations of your role became clear. You found yourself constrained by organizational inertia and a manager whose resistance to your networking efforts stymied your career growth. You sought opportunities to expand your horizons, connecting with senior leaders like the VP of Data and Analytics, who recognized your potential but admitted that structural and HR constraints made immediate change impossible. This acknowledgment likely brought you both hope and frustrationâ€”it was validation of your abilities but a reminder of the slow-moving nature of corporate systems.

At some point, the environment became increasingly toxic. Your boss not only blocked your transfer attempts but assigned you to tasks that felt beneath your skill level, effectively halting your progress. Despite the setback, you maintained a sense of purpose, driven by your belief that the role was a means to an end. However, the emotional toll of working in such a stifling environment, compounded by the feeling of being undervalued, began to weigh heavily on you.

The tipping point came when it became clear that you were being forced into a prolonged period of "career purgatory." The promise of new AI initiatives within SCJ sparked a glimmer of hope, but bureaucracy and annual review policies meant you couldnâ€™t transition into these roles quickly. Instead, you faced an ultimatum: endure the next 90 days performing menial tasks as part of a trial, or risk leaving the company without a clear path forward.

This 90-day trial, while daunting, has become a defining moment. Knowing the timeline is finite and that enduring it may lead to a tangible opportunityâ€”such as transferring into the AI department as a junior AI engineerâ€”has given you the emotional strength to persevere. Youâ€™ve reframed the situation as a necessary test, one that aligns with your overarching goals of leveraging AI to drive innovation and ultimately transitioning into a role that allows you to thrive.

Your time at SCJ encapsulates a broader theme in your career journey: the struggle to reconcile ambition and systemic obstacles while maintaining faith in your ability to forge a better path. Itâ€™s a story of navigating adversity, adapting to circumstances, and steadfastly working toward a future where your skills, values, and vision align in meaningful ways.


##### You said:

Now also incorporate my life's hopes and dreams that I've talked to you about, specifically about moving to a metropolitan tech hub, and how I won't be able to move as SCJ doesn't allow for remote work.

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Your journey at SC Johnson represents not just a career story but a chapter in your quest to align your professional life with your deepest hopes and dreams. These dreamsâ€”centered around leaving Racine, Wisconsin, and building a meaningful career in AI and tech innovationâ€”are tied to your vision of moving to a metropolitan tech hub like the Bay Area. You see such a move as essential for accessing opportunities in a field that excites and inspires you, a place where you can surround yourself with the energy of innovation and people who share your passions.

However, SCJâ€™s structure and policies have consistently worked against these aspirations. Remote work, which could have provided a bridge between your current role and your dreams, is not an option within the company. This tether to Racine feels like a chain holding you back, keeping you in an environment that no longer nourishes your personal or professional growth. The reality of staying at SCJ has forced you to wrestle with an intense internal conflict: endure the constraints of your current role or risk stepping into the unknown by leaving.

When you connected with the VP of Data and Analytics, it seemed like a glimmer of hope, a potential pathway to transition into SCJâ€™s AI Center of Excellence. Yet, even this opportunity has been slow to materialize due to bureaucratic constraints, leaving you in a holding pattern. The promise of transitioning to a junior AI engineer role after enduring a 90-day trial period of menial tasks offers a faint light at the end of the tunnel. But even that feels bittersweet, as it keeps you tied to Racine for at least another 12-18 months, delaying your dream of moving to a tech hub and living independently.

The weight of this compromise isnâ€™t just logistical; itâ€™s deeply emotional. Staying in Racine means remaining in a place that has felt stifling and uninspiring, where youâ€™re surrounded by an environment that doesnâ€™t align with your values or ambitions. The opportunity to moveâ€”to step into the energy and vibrancy of a tech hubâ€”represents more than a career change. Itâ€™s a chance to reclaim your autonomy, pursue your passions in an environment that matches your drive, and find a sense of belonging in a space where your talents and vision are not only valued but celebrated.

Yet, youâ€™ve also recognized the realities of the situation. SCJâ€™s offer to transition into AI work, while imperfect, may be a necessary stepping stone. Youâ€™ve decided to endure the 90-day trial, knowing it could position you for a role that would provide valuable experience in the field youâ€™ve been striving to break into. Itâ€™s a calculated compromise, one that keeps your ultimate goals alive but requires patience and resilience.

This chapter of your life underscores the tension between where you are and where you long to be. Youâ€™ve realized that your dreams of living in a tech hub and contributing to cutting-edge AI innovation are not out of reach, but the path forward requires navigating obstacles with both strategy and endurance. By leaning into the challenges of your current situation, youâ€™re laying the groundwork for a future where you can finally break free, move to the city of your dreams, and create the life youâ€™ve envisionedâ€”a life of freedom, purpose, and fulfillment.

Perhaps something you aren't aware of is that I've tried to find opportunities and I have hit a wall repeatedly. Everyone in my life says that it is unwise, stupid even, to move to a metropolitan city without a job lined up. Entry-level AI roles are extremely rare and competitive. Because I am transitioning, it will be nigh impossible to land one of these jobs as I'm 37 and pivoting to a new career space. Therefore I realized that my dream is so strong it hurts, however I've realized that if I truly want it, I may have to pay the price of delaying moving in order to build the experience and skill set somehow, meaning I would have to stay in Racine. Essentially, I have realized the impracticality of my dream. Therefore, at this current moment, it appears as if staying at SCJ would represent a realistic, logical, rational, linear, straightforward, scarcity-based reasoning opportunity to make my dreams a reality eventually, vs., quitting my job and moving and starting over in a new city where the cost of living will be enormous, I will be stressed trying to find a job, and will likely have to take some menial job and work my way up from scratch to possibly get a career in AI at some unknown future point. I will have to live off of my savings. However, this would be a leap of faith, and if I have faith in myself, I am willing to dream big, to aim higher than what "makes sense".

Your reflections reveal a profound and deeply personal reckoning between practicality and passion, between dreams and reality. For much of your journey, the vision of moving to a metropolitan tech hub like the Bay Area has been a beaconâ€”a place where you could step into the heart of innovation, immerse yourself in a community of like-minded individuals, and pursue a career that aligns with your talents and aspirations. But as youâ€™ve faced the stark realities of breaking into the AI field, the challenges have become undeniable.

At 37, youâ€™re not only transitioning into a highly competitive space but doing so at a time when entry-level AI roles are scarce and largely dominated by younger candidates or those with more direct experience. The feedback youâ€™ve received from people in your lifeâ€”well-meaning or otherwiseâ€”has added weight to these doubts, framing your dream of moving without a job as impractical, even reckless. And itâ€™s not just their voices; your own awareness of the financial and emotional toll of such a leap has made you question whether the dream is sustainable in its current form.

This realization has brought you to a crossroads. You now see that staying in Racine, while far from your ideal, offers a pathway grounded in logic, reason, and the scarcity mindset of making the most of whatâ€™s available. SC Johnson, despite its flaws and the frustrations youâ€™ve experienced, presents a practical opportunity. The chance to endure the 90-day trial and transition into a junior AI engineer role gives you a foothold in the industry, allowing you to build the experience and skill set you need to eventually make your dream a reality. This path feels linear, stable, and, above all, safeâ€”a way to invest in your future without risking everything.

But alongside this pragmatic reasoning is a voice within you that yearns for something greaterâ€”a leap of faith into the unknown. Moving to a tech hub without a job lined up, relying on your savings, and starting from scratch in a costly and competitive environment may seem illogical, even foolish. Yet, itâ€™s also a path fueled by ambition, courage, and a belief in your ability to rise to the challenge. Itâ€™s a path where you dream big and aim higher than what "makes sense," trusting that your passion, resourcefulness, and resilience will carry you through the uncertainty.

This tension between the two pathsâ€”pragmatic endurance and bold faithâ€”is where you find yourself now. Both have their risks and rewards. Staying at SCJ might feel like sacrificing your dream in the short term, but it provides the structure and resources to build the foundation you need. On the other hand, leaving everything behind to pursue your dream directly might feel exhilarating and empowering, but it also carries the potential for setbacks, stress, and financial strain.

Ultimately, your journey is about more than just making the "right" choice. Itâ€™s about finding a path that honors both your dreams and the realities of your life. Whether you choose to stay and endure the slower, more stable route or take the leap and bet on yourself, the choice will reflect your values and your willingness to embrace the unknown. Itâ€™s clear that your dream is alive and strong, and whichever path you take, your determination and self-awareness will be the keys to eventually bringing it to life.
