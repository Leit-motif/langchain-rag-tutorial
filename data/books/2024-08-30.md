# Journal

I had a heart to heart with my mother. It was nice hearing from her own mouth that she understood that her sickness was an attempt at a slow suicide. I was able to convey to her that I was abandoned from a young age, and the damage that it caused me. I was also able to convey to her my views on [[God]] and [[religion]]. I was able to tell her about my plan that I need to quit my job and move, and that [[God]] supports those that support themselves.

What is my ideal Tuesday, Sunday?

What do I need to feel to be true, for this to be disempowering for me? Where you have opportunity to reclaim and reconnect with the [[power]] within you. Anytime we act for a place of disempowerment, we are perpetuating a childhood belief. We need to identify and reintegrate that which we've shadowed. We need to remember that we'll always have [[power]]. 

[[Fear]] is the basis of respect

Go first, go positive, and be constant in doing it.

# Tarot Reading: What will happen if I quit my job and move to a metropolitan city?

## Reading 1 
### Card 1: **9 of Pentacles (Reversed)**

The 9 of Pentacles in its upright position usually signifies [[wealth]], [[self]]-sufficiency, and enjoying the fruits of your labor. However, in its reversed position, it suggests concerns about your financial stability or a sense of dissatisfaction despite material [[success]]. This card warns of potential pitfalls related to overindulgence, dependency, or even financial instability. It may indicate that leaving your job could disrupt your current sense of [[security]] or that you might face challenges in maintaining your standard of living in the new city. There could also be a feeling of [[loneliness]] or isolation, as the reversed 9 of Pentacles sometimes suggests a lack of fulfillment despite external appearances.

### Card 2: **Knight of Wands**

The Knight of Wands represents boldness, [[adventure]], and a passionate drive toward new experiences. This card is filled with [[energy]] and suggests that you're feeling a strong urge to make this change, driven by a desire for excitement and new opportunities. The Knight of Wands is all about movement, suggesting that you have the enthusiasm and [[courage]] needed to make the leap to a new [[environment]]. However, the Knight can also be impulsive, sometimes acting without fully considering the consequences. This card encourages you to channel your passion wisely and ensure that your decisions are well-thought-out rather than made in the heat of the moment.

### Card 3: **8 of Swords (Reversed)**

The 8 of Swords typically depicts a situation of feeling trapped or restricted by circumstances, but when reversed, it signals a release from these limitations. In this context, it suggests that moving to the metropolitan city could help you break free from current restrictions or mental blocks. You may find new perspectives, opportunities, or a sense of [[liberation]] in the new [[environment]]. The reversal of the 8 of Swords often points to a situation where you're starting to see the way out of a difficult situation, which could imply that this move might open doors you hadn't previously considered.

### **Overall Interpretation**

Your [[Tarot]] spread presents a nuanced picture of the potential outcome of quitting your job and relocating to a metropolitan city:

- **Financial and Emotional Risks (9 of Pentacles Reversed):** The move might pose challenges to your financial stability and could bring some emotional or psychological [[discomfort]]. It’s essential to carefully evaluate your financial situation and ensure you have a solid plan before making the move.
    
- **Desire for Change and [[Adventure]] (Knight of Wands):** You're driven by a strong desire for change and [[adventure]], which could bring significant excitement and new experiences into your life. However, ensure that your enthusiasm is balanced with careful planning.
    
- **Potential for [[Liberation]] and New Perspectives (8 of Swords Reversed):** The move could help you break free from current limitations and offer a fresh perspective on life. You may find yourself shedding old fears or restrictions and embracing new possibilities.
    

In summary, the cards suggest that while there are risks involved, particularly concerning financial stability and potential emotional challenges, the move could also offer a sense of [[liberation]] and the fulfillment of your desire for [[adventure]]. If you’re prepared to face the potential challenges with careful planning and a clear understanding of the risks, this move could ultimately lead to personal [[growth]] and new opportunities.

### **Card 1: 9 of Pentacles (Reversed)**

#### **Traditional Meaning:**

The 9 of Pentacles traditionally represents [[self]]-sufficiency, financial [[independence]], and the enjoyment of material comforts. It depicts a person who has worked hard to achieve a state of comfort and [[security]], enjoying the rewards of their labor.

#### **Reversed Interpretation:**

When reversed, the 9 of Pentacles indicates a disruption in this sense of [[security]] and comfort. This could manifest as financial instability, a loss of [[independence]], or feelings of dissatisfaction despite outward [[success]]. There may be a sense that the material aspects of your life, which once provided comfort, no longer bring the same level of satisfaction or fulfillment.

- **Financial Concerns:** Moving to a metropolitan city often comes with increased costs of living. The reversed 9 of Pentacles suggests that you might face financial challenges in adjusting to these new expenses. It’s important to assess whether you have the financial reserves to sustain yourself during this transition period.
    
- **Dependency:** This card also warns against the potential for becoming dependent on others, whether emotionally, financially, or otherwise. In a new city, where the cost of living might be higher and the [[environment]] more competitive, you could find yourself relying on others more than you'd like.
    
- **Superficial [[Success]]:** There might be a danger of focusing too much on outward appearances, chasing after a lifestyle or image that doesn't truly satisfy you. This could lead to a hollow sense of [[success]], where you achieve the external markers of prosperity without feeling genuinely fulfilled.
    
- **[[Loneliness]] or Isolation:** The reversed 9 of Pentacles can also point to feelings of isolation, even in a bustling city. You may find it challenging to connect with others or to feel truly at home in the new [[environment]].
    

### **Card 2: Knight of Wands**

#### **Traditional Meaning:**

The Knight of Wands is the embodiment of [[energy]], passion, and a desire for [[adventure]]. This card represents someone who is eager to embark on new journeys, take risks, and pursue their goals with enthusiasm. The Knight of Wands is often seen as a trailblazer, willing to take bold steps and face challenges head-on.

#### **In-Depth Interpretation:**

- **Driving Force:** The Knight of Wands suggests that you're being driven by a strong internal force to make this move. This could be a desire for change, the pursuit of new opportunities, or a need to break free from the monotony of your current situation. Your [[energy]] and enthusiasm are high, and you're eager to take on the challenges that a new city might present.
    
- **[[Risk]] and Reward:** However, the Knight of Wands is also a card of impulsiveness. While your passion is a great asset, it’s crucial to ensure that you're not acting too hastily. Consider whether you've fully thought through the practical implications of such a significant change. Are you prepared for the obstacles that might arise? The Knight of Wands encourages you to temper your enthusiasm with a dose of realism.
    
- **Pursuit of Goals:** This card indicates that you're likely to pursue your goals with vigor once you move. The Knight of Wands suggests that the new city might offer you the excitement and challenges you crave, potentially leading to significant personal [[growth]]. However, be mindful of burnout or scattering your [[energy]] too thinly across too many pursuits.
    
- **Creative [[Energy]]:** The Knight of Wands also represents creative [[energy]] and the pursuit of passions. If your current job or [[environment]] feels stifling, moving to a metropolitan city might provide the stimulus you need to reignite your creative spark or explore new [[career]] paths.
    

### **Card 3: 8 of Swords (Reversed)**

#### **Traditional Meaning:**

The 8 of Swords in its upright position typically represents feelings of entrapment, restriction, and a lack of options. It suggests being stuck in a difficult situation, often due to [[self]]-imposed limitations or a lack of perspective.

#### **Reversed Interpretation:**

When reversed, the 8 of Swords indicates a release from these restrictions. This card suggests that you’re beginning to see a way out of a limiting situation, gaining clarity, and finding the [[courage]] to take action.

- **[[Liberation]] from Constraints:** The reversed 8 of Swords is a powerful indicator of breaking free from old patterns, fears, or limitations. Moving to a metropolitan city could symbolize a significant step toward freeing yourself from whatever has been holding you back in your current job or [[environment]]. This could be a mental shift, where you start to believe more in your capabilities, or a physical change that removes you from a restrictive situation.
    
- **New Perspectives:** The move might help you see your life from a new angle. The reversed 8 of Swords suggests that you’ll gain new insights and perspectives in the city, allowing you to overcome challenges that previously seemed insurmountable. This card indicates that you may find solutions to problems that have been plaguing you for some [[time]], simply by changing your [[environment]] and mindset.
    
- **Overcoming [[Fear]]:** [[Fear]] of the unknown often holds us back, but the reversed 8 of Swords indicates that you’re ready to confront these fears and take control of your destiny. Moving to a new city can be daunting, but this card suggests that you have the inner strength to face these challenges and emerge stronger.
    
- **Renewed Empowerment:** Ultimately, the reversed 8 of Swords points to a process of empowerment. You’re likely to feel more in control of your life and decisions after making this move. The shift to a metropolitan city might provide you with the resources, connections, or opportunities needed to regain a sense of agency and [[freedom]].
    

### **Integrated Interpretation:**

Bringing together the meanings of these three cards, your [[Tarot]] spread paints a picture of a journey filled with both potential challenges and opportunities:

1. **Potential Financial and Emotional Risks (9 of Pentacles Reversed):** The move may disrupt your current sense of [[security]], particularly in financial terms. There’s a need to be cautious about your spending and ensure that you're not chasing superficial [[success]] at the expense of true satisfaction.
    
2. **Drive for Change and [[Adventure]] (Knight of Wands):** Your desire for change is strong, and this move could bring about the excitement and new experiences you're seeking. However, it's crucial to balance this enthusiasm with careful planning to avoid impulsive decisions.
    
3. **[[Liberation]] and New Perspectives (8 of Swords Reversed):** The move could be highly liberating, helping you break free from current limitations and opening your eyes to new possibilities. You’re likely to gain new insights and feel more empowered in your new [[environment]].
    

### **Final Advice:**

- **Prepare for the Financial Shift:** Consider creating a detailed financial plan before making the move. Ensure that you have a safety net in place to handle the increased costs of living in a metropolitan city.
    
- **Harness Your Passion:** While your excitement about the move is a positive force, remember to ground your decisions in reality. Make sure your plans are thorough and consider the long-term implications.
    
- **Embrace the New Perspective:** Be open to the changes and new perspectives that this move will bring. While there may be challenges, the potential for personal [[growth]] and [[liberation]] is significant.
    

In summary, the cards suggest that this move could be a powerful catalyst for change in your life. While there are risks, particularly in terms of financial stability, the potential for personal [[liberation]], [[growth]], and new opportunities is substantial. If you approach the move with careful planning and an open mind, it could lead to a fulfilling and transformative experience.
