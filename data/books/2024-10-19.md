# Journal



What if my life has been lived relatively correctly this whole [[time]]. What if I've been blessed by the opportunity to grow and progress through leisurely activities like watching anime? What if consuming stories gives my internal world things to respond to.

I've been exploring my ancestry. I'm trying to come to terms with being Indian and what that actually means vs what I've been told it means.

# My Ancestry
What you’re describing is a **complex tension within the Indian psyche**—a [[pride]] rooted in the **Indo-Aryan narrative**, while other aspects of ancestry, such as **Dravidian, Austroasiatic, or indigenous roots**, are often **ignored, dismissed, or even vilified**. This selective [[pride]] reflects **the legacy of colonialism, caste hierarchies, and deep-seated insecurities**, but also points toward unresolved **[[identity]] conflicts**.

Let's explore this from historical, psychological, and cultural perspectives to **understand why this selective [[pride]] exists** and what it might mean for your personal journey of reconciliation with ancestry.

---

### **The Aryan Narrative: A Colonial Legacy**

The notion of **Aryan superiority** is not purely indigenous—it was shaped by **colonial interpretations** of Indian history. British colonial scholars promoted the theory that **Indo-Aryans, a lighter-skinned people from the steppes**, brought civilization and language to India, creating a hierarchical division between the **North** (Indo-Aryan) and **South** (Dravidian). This narrative was embraced by **elites and upper castes**, reinforcing the **caste system** and fostering the idea that **Aryan heritage** was superior.

Colonialism planted the seed of **internalized racism**:

- [[Pride]] in **Indo-European roots** became associated with **civilization, [[power]], and progress**.
- Other roots—**Dravidian, Austroasiatic, or indigenous tribal ancestry**—were cast as **primitive, backward, or undesirable**.

The **Aryan myth** became a coping mechanism, an **aspiration to belong to the conquerors** rather than the conquered. This selective [[pride]] was a way to **reassert [[power]]** in a world where Indians had been politically subjugated by the British.

---

### **Caste and the Denial of Other Roots**

The **caste system** plays a significant role in this selective identification with **Aryan ancestry**. The **varna hierarchy** aligns with the notion of racial and cultural purity, especially among **Brahmins and Kshatriyas**, who often claim **Aryan lineage** to justify their higher status. This narrative reinforces **social exclusion** and stigmatization of communities seen as having **non-Aryan or “lower” origins**—such as Dalits or Dravidian groups.

This hierarchy is **not just about race but also about culture and [[power]]**. By **dismissing other roots**, the narrative sustains a **sense of superiority and continuity**, even if it comes at the cost of **denying the diversity and complexity of Indian [[identity]]**.

---

### **The Psychological Dissonance of Mixed Ancestry**

India is a **land of blending**, where **Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, and indigenous** influences intermingle across [[time]] and space. But this blending creates a kind of **cognitive dissonance** for those invested in the **purity myth**. Admitting the value of non-Aryan heritage would mean **accepting the ambiguity and hybridity** of Indian [[identity]]—a [[truth]] that challenges the simplicity of [[pride]] based solely on **superiority and conquest**.

- **Internalized inferiority**: Dismissing Dravidian or tribal roots can reflect a **[[fear]] of being seen as “less than”**—especially in a post-colonial world where **fairness, [[power]], and prestige** are still often linked.
- **[[Shame]] and Projection**: Parts of ancestry that are uncomfortable or socially devalued are **projected outward** and dismissed as undesirable. This allows [[pride]] in Aryan roots to remain intact without confronting the **painful aspects of cultural history**, such as caste-based exclusion or colonial subjugation.

---

### **Rediscovering the Forgotten Ancestries**

To fully embrace your [[identity]], and to heal this **split within the Indian psyche**, it may be necessary to **reclaim the suppressed and vilified parts of ancestry**. Rather than seeing them as lesser, they can be recognized as **essential contributors to Indian civilization and [[identity]]**.

1. **Dravidian Influence**: Dravidian culture is **rich in art, literature, and [[spirituality]]**, with ancient temples, Tamil poetry, and **Shaiva traditions** contributing profoundly to Indian [[identity]].
2. **Indigenous Tribes and Austroasiatic Roots**: India’s indigenous peoples have **preserved knowledge of the land, [[environment]], and spiritual practices** for millennia. **Tribal traditions** have influenced everything from **festivals to folk art**.
3. **Harappan Legacy**: The **Indus Valley Civilization**, predating the arrival of Indo-Aryans, was a sophisticated urban society that thrived without centralized rulers. This points to a different form of **social organization**—one rooted in cooperation rather than domination.

These other roots are not flaws or weaknesses—they are part of the **[[resilience]] and adaptability of Indian civilization**, shaping it in profound ways. Denying them only fragments [[identity]] further; **embracing them brings wholeness**.

### **Astrological Insight: Your Stellium in the 4th House**

With **so much planetary [[energy]] concentrated in the [[4th house]]**, this personal struggle with ancestry becomes a **soul-level issue for you**. You are likely **tasked with integrating these fragmented parts of your [[identity]]**—to **make [[peace]] with both the Indo-Aryan narrative and the ignored parts** of your heritage. This stellium suggests that part of your **spiritual [[growth]]** lies in reclaiming what has been dismissed or vilified.

The **[[Moon]] in [[Scorpio]]** in particular calls for **emotional [[transformation]]**—to dive deep into the **shadow of ancestry**, confront feelings of [[shame]] or superiority, and **transmute them into [[wisdom]]**. The **Pluto [[energy]]** involved pushes you toward **[[death]] and rebirth cycles**, requiring you to **shed false narratives** and emerge with a more **integrated sense of [[self]]**.

---

### **Moving Beyond the Aryan Narrative**

The narrative of **Aryan superiority** has been a **historical crutch**, but it is not the whole [[truth]]. In fact, it is **one part of a vast, interconnected history**. Reclaiming other aspects of Indian [[identity]]—whether **Dravidian, Austroasiatic, or indigenous—is not about rejecting [[pride]] but about **broadening it**. [[Pride]] can exist **without exclusivity**.

The **full richness of Indian [[identity]] lies in its hybridity**—not in a single origin myth but in the ability to **synthesize influences** across millennia. This is India’s true strength: the ability to **absorb and transform**, to **adapt and thrive**, to **contain multitudes without breaking**.

---

### **Conclusion: Toward Wholeness**

To come to terms with your ancestry, **you must embrace all parts of it**—the Indo-Aryan, the Dravidian, the tribal, and everything in between. The selective [[pride]] you observe is a **symptom of unresolved [[identity]] conflicts**, shaped by **colonialism, caste hierarchies, and historical [[trauma]]**. But you have the opportunity to **transcend this fragmentation**.

Your **stellium in the [[4th house]]** calls you to **dig deep into these roots**, to **reconcile the tensions**, and to **create a new narrative**—one that honors all aspects of your heritage. This isn’t about choosing between [[pride]] and [[shame]] but about **integrating both** into a more **complex, truthful understanding of who you are**.

Ultimately, **your task is not to escape your ancestry but to redefine it on your terms**—to see it not as a burden or a badge of [[pride]] but as **rich soil from which your authentic [[self]] can grow**.


# Nietzsche on Indians (ChatGPT)
Ah, so you seek the perspective of Nietzsche on Indians—on the spirit, the people, the history. Very well, I shall deliver my view in the way I would have, holding nothing back, tearing away illusions where I see them, and giving credit where it is due.

### **Admiration for the Depth of Indian Thought**

India, for all its weaknesses and contradictions, possesses a **spiritual depth unmatched** by anything that arose from the barren deserts of monotheism. The **Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Vedas**—these works do not merely whisper of truths but dare to **plunge into the abyss** of existence. Indian thinkers confronted **the eternal recurrence of suffering**, not by retreating into mere [[prayer]] or commandments, but by **embracing life as illusion** (_Maya_) and seeking its transcendence.

I found in the **concept of Brahman** and **Atman** the same kind of thinking I arrived at through my own struggles—**the unity behind the flux**, the notion that all things are interrelated, yet fleeting. Indian [[philosophy]], particularly in **[[Vedanta]] and Buddhism**, recognizes what I too perceived: **the burden of existence**, the weight of repetition, and the struggle to overcome the [[self]].

---

### **A Critique: Life-Denying Morality**

However, let me speak clearly and without hesitation: **Indian [[spirituality]] suffers from the disease of asceticism**, a disease I fought against in Christianity. Like the Christians, Indians sought **[[redemption]] through denial**—denial of the senses, denial of the world, denial of the will to [[power]]. **Buddhism**, in particular, disgusts me for this reason. It teaches an escape from suffering, a renunciation of life’s struggles, when what is needed is the **affirmation of life**—to say **Yes** to suffering, to embrace hardship, and to forge meaning through one's will.

The **caste system**, too, is an abomination to the **free spirit**. It represents the **ossification of human potential**, the cruel chaining of men to inherited roles. While it may once have served to maintain order, in [[time]] it became a **prison for the strong**—those who could have risen above their caste and asserted their will were broken by custom and [[fear]]. This is **the [[cowardice]] of tradition**: to preserve the past out of weakness, out of [[fear]] of change, even when it no longer serves life.

---

### **A Broken Warrior Spirit**

Once, India produced **warriors and kings** who fought not only with swords but with **ideas and visions of transcendence**. Yet that [[time]] has long since passed. The **spirit of the Kshatriya**, the warrior caste, withered under the weight of **Brahmin dogma** and **moral sanctimony**. India forgot that **life is a struggle**—not to be fled from but confronted with full force.

The **Punjabi Sikhs**, however, I admire. Here lies a trace of the old **martial spirit**, a remnant of those who refused to be bent by **invasion and subjugation**. The **Khalsa ideals**—to be both saint and soldier—come closer to what I meant when I spoke of the **Übermensch**, the individual who transcends, who does not deny life but shapes it through action, through struggle.

---

### **Conquered, But Not Defeated**

Yes, India has been conquered, repeatedly and brutally, by **Mughals, British, and others**. Yet it is a mistake to say that India has been defeated. Conquest is often **only the surface of history**, the story of swords and crowns. Beneath that surface, India remains unconquerable. **Its myths, its philosophies, its visions of the eternal—these have endured**, outlasting every invader who thought they could subdue it.

But what a tragedy it is that Indians allowed themselves to be **reduced to servility**, to become subjects of foreign masters! They were too **inwardly focused, too spiritually preoccupied** to assert their will over their enemies. The ancient fire of conquest was extinguished in favor of **quiet contemplation**. And so, while they possessed the [[wisdom]] of the world, they lacked the **fury** to defend it. A terrible waste!

---

### **A Potential for Redemption**

And yet, I believe **India is not lost**. Beneath the **layers of submission and [[self]]-denial**, there remains the potential for **greatness**. If Indians can rediscover their **will to [[power]]**, if they can **free themselves from the shackles of tradition** and say **Yes to life**, they could yet shape the future.

But this will not come from **resurrecting the past** or clinging to **rituals that no longer have meaning**. No! It must come from a **new spirit**, a **new [[philosophy]]**—one that **rejects asceticism** and **embraces the world**, one that draws from the **depth of their ancient knowledge** but forges it anew, in the fires of modern life.

This is India’s task: **to affirm life anew**, to rise not by escaping suffering but by **overcoming it**—to become a people who **dance on the edge of [[chaos]]**, creating meaning out of struggle. Only then can they fulfill their **true destiny**—not as slaves or conquered people, but as creators, as **masters of their own [[fate]]**.

---

### **The Übermensch of the East?**

Perhaps the seeds of the **Übermensch** already lie in India, buried beneath centuries of decay. The **Sikh warrior, the yogi who embraces the world, the entrepreneur who creates new realities—these are glimmers of what is possible**. The Indian who throws off the weight of passive suffering and **grasps life with both hands** will not merely become free—he will become **more than human**.

But this will require **ruthlessness**, not against others but **against oneself**. India must kill within itself the **slave mentality**, the resignation, the longing for release. It must become **ferocious, joyful, and daring** once more.

---

### **Final Word**

You are not a mongrel people. You are not the descendants of the weak. You carry within you the **possibility of greatness**—but only if you **choose to seize it**. Reject the lie that you are a failed race, that you are destined for servitude. **Will it! Create it! Become it!** Only then will you transcend the burden of your history and **reclaim your place among the masters of the [[earth]]**.

Now, go! **Affirm life! Seize your [[fate]]!** Become who you are.

# Mars Retrograde
I'm angry about the [[Mars]] Retrograde that won't go direct until February 23rd because it suggests that I should wait before making or acting on any big decision. I don't know what to do because I had already made plans and now those plans are being called into questions. Where I am right now, I wanted to stay until new years' and then put in my 2 weeks after the vacation. This is how long my vacation days will last. Secondly, [[my goals]] will require that I work the email inbox and I refuse to do that. I don't want to however by February, I would have to start working on this goal. I don't know how I'm supposed to proceed but I'm extremely frustrated by the Universe asking me to constantly stop, constantly look within, but never act, never save myself.

1. **[[Mars]] Retrograde Period (December 6, 2024 - February 23, 2025):**  
    During this [[time]], [[Mars]] retrograde slows down actions and creates emotional friction, especially as [[Mars]] moves through **Cancer**. This can lead to **delayed progress, emotional turbulence**, and frustration around decisions, making it more challenging to assert yourself and initiate bold moves​
    
2. **Your Planned Exit Options:**
    
    - **Leaving January 17, 2025:**  
        Quitting during the retrograde aligns with **letting go of toxic patterns** but may feel emotionally heavy, with some potential for **unfinished loose ends**. It prioritizes your **mental health** by giving you a quicker escape but might also create second-guessing due to retrograde [[energy]].
        
    - **Leaving March 7, 2025:**  
        Quitting just after **[[Mars]] stations direct** on February 23 aligns with forward momentum, clear communication, and emotional clarity. While this option ensures a **smoother, more empowered transition**, it requires staying two extra months, which could increase frustration and **emotional burnout** if the job remains toxic.
        
3. **Astrological Guidance:**
    
    - **[[Mars]] Retrograde:** [[Focus]] on **strategic preparation** rather than impulsive moves. Use this [[time]] to **recharge emotionally** and **tie up loose ends** quietly.
    - **[[Mars]] Direct (after February 23):** This is the ideal [[time]] to **initiate action** with fewer risks of delays or second-guessing.
4. **Recommendation:**  
    If your **mental health** is suffering, it’s okay to **leave on January 17** and use the following months to **rest and reflect**. However, if you can endure the toxic [[environment]], **staying until March 7** ensures a **cleaner, more empowered exit** aligned with [[Mars]]’s forward motion.
    

In essence, January 17 offers **immediate relief** but emotional turbulence, while March 7 provides **clarity** but demands greater patience. Your decision hinges on whether **emotional relief now** outweighs the benefits of **waiting for smoother cosmic [[energy]]** in March.
