How do I turn a damsel into stress into a hero? A victim into a ___ .

[[Self]] [[love]] can't be conditional on performance. Therefore can't evaluate performatively. 

Lovely to be unconditional. [[Self]] needs to be defined as the entire Universe. Before as a matter of fact you can only [[love]] everything simply for existing, no other conclusion is higher.

Loving reality by loving the unfolding present, which is the acting Universe, that you already claimed you [[love]], by [[virtue]] of loving your [[Self]]. The present moment is the expression of [[Self]], of Source. 

In ancient societies, it was only the slaves that understood the concept of freedom. We only come to know something through the lack of it. Why heal? We have an enormous compassion for the people that were once in the place that we were in, in bondage.

Fear of winter halts the cycle of the seasons. You're stuck in late fall early winter for the rest of your life. The ground must be allowed to lay fallow before it's ready for planting in the spring.
