# Journal

It's finally over. She's gone. I have died the third death. I established my boundary of "no contract". I need to get over her. Our stories are no longer intertwined. I know she's not right for me. I just wanted what we used to have. I always told myself (secretly) that I would make things right. But I didn't. I fucked up. It's too late. We can never go back.

How is Victoria's character still weak? She lacks discipline. She doesn't try hard enough. She only wants to play games. She has no ambition (other than ambition internalized from me.) She isn't particularly smart. She has a limited scope on interests (other than space). The hobbies and interests that are genuinely hers are boring. She is a mirror of my interests. She didn't nourish my mind, only my heart. She also took from my heart, not just one way. She doesn't care enough about her problems or body. It was only through my influence that she started the appropriate self-improvement habits. While this list is not comprehensive, the person I meet next will embody some or all of these qualities. 

Victoria taught me how to love and that the limits of the human heart are near endless.
