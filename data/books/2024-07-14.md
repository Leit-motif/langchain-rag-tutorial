# Recap

## What did I do well?

I assembled the TV mount. It was incredibly frustrating however I eventually mastered my frustration and entered a clarity of thought. I was able to push through every [[uncertainty]] and I was able to accomplish my task! I now have the tools to move forward in life. I can conquer anything. I also enjoyed that I was able to do it by myself and do to a task that is associated with [[independence]]. 

## What could I have done better?

I only consume content but I don‚Äôt create (enough). I don‚Äôt take enough action. I won‚Äôt get results unless I take more action. I won‚Äôt be able to move on in life until I take more action.

## The world has no place for the weak

Today, I am angry at my [[father]] and mother. My dad keeps intentionally making life difficult for my mom and brother. He purposely displaces himself as a way to punish my mother for not responding to his demands. He is like a newborn baby, throwing tantrums and playing mind games with the mother in order to solicit the demands of a rampant ego. The ego has not yet learned that internal demands are to be balanced by external constraints. 

I hate my mother because she is weak and on top of being weak, she is a coward that runs away. She wasn‚Äôt strong enough to protect me throughout my life. I already acknowledge that my dad is a piece of shit. He‚Äôs human trash. Fine, it happens. But my mother, she‚Äôs supposed to be the lioness, the strong one. Yet, as I look back on my life, it is a string of her abandoning me because she sought to run away from her circumstances, circumstances that she was too weak to face head-on. She was coerced into a marriage she didn‚Äôt want, she chose wrong, and then sought a slow psychic suicide in order to escape her circumstances. That was the cause of her heart problems. I knew this from a young age. So she was constantly on the verge of dying and couldn‚Äôt be there for her children. However, it was she that was running away, it was her own doing. As I grew into a teenager, puberty enabled me to finally exercise my will for myself. My [[father]] was incapable of providing for the family, so I took actions into my own hand. As a result, I was placed in Gang Crime as a punishment for asserting my autonomy. My dad decided to put me in Gang Crime because he was too weak and selfish to provide for his family. He didn‚Äôt do what needed to be done and I forced the issue, I refused to take on his burdens. I refused to accept his weakness. This would have been fine, but my mom chose to back him instead of me. Again, she didn‚Äôt protect me when I needed her most. She was a coward her whole life, but in this matter, in this one time in her whole life, she chose to remain steadfast. They both chose to show [[power]] only against their son, only to keep me down. In no other arena in their life did they show [[power]]. They were trash the entire time. Slaves, peasants, weak pieces of shit. Pushed around as beasts of burden by life. But to their own son, ah, they suddenly grew a back bone. 

I cannot and will not forgive either of them because it was their choice. Everyone has [[trauma]], but everyone also has free choice. Everyone has the [[responsibility]] of raising their consciousness. The worst part is that they ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù to be religious. Any [[religion]] that allows for them, is no [[religion]] of mine. It is spiritual bypassing, nothing more. 

There‚Äôs nothing to forgive either. It cant be undone. the [[trust]] was broken.
