# Daily [[Gratitude]]

# Dream
I had a dream about Victoria it was tough I was [[moving out]] it was our old apartment except most things were grayscale and what was bad about this is that not only was I [[moving out]] it was actually I was being kicked out and Brandon was moving in simultaneously there was a section where I had to go through all the different dark spaces of the apartment and I was scared to and I looked through all of the closets but they were empty I recall being very sad it felt like a final goodbye I know there was a part where there was a cat that was muffin but she was gray she wasn't her standard color and the cat didn't seem to recognize me there was a part where I had to get a key to unlock something in my throat but I couldn't see what would come of it and I agreed to the deal there was a part where I was riding on a boat through water seemingly in the middle of that dream it was almost like a dream within a dream and as the dream went on it became less sad and I was more accepting of what was going on the dream took a tone of like I am strong enough I am okay I got this and then towards the end it was interesting that there was a different girl and it was someone I knew she was my new girlfriend it seemed and I was able to stop her and she was beautiful and I even lowered her for a blowjob and it felt very familiar, happy. I had met Brandon at some point in this dream sequence.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]
I am thankful for the [[peace]] in my heart I've been feeling as of late. The waters roared and roared and now I am starting to feel a profound stillness. The clouds still darken the sky, but my heart feels as if the storm has suddenly lifted. The birds being to sing intermittently.

Chase things and follow them to their inevitable conclusions there were so many times during life where you were shown the correct path but you just dipped a toe instead of deep diving to be where you are now you could have been there 10, 15 20 years ago.
