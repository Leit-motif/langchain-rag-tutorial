# Daily Law
## Use the Surrender Tactic

When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conquerors, time to wait for their [[power]] to wane. Do not give them the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you—surrender first. By turning the other cheek you infuriate and unsettle them. Make surrender a tool of [[power]]. And keep in mind the following: people trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack.

> Daily Law: If you find yourself temporarily weakened, the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourself up again—it disguises your [[ambition]]; it teaches you patience and [[self]]-control, key skills in the game.
