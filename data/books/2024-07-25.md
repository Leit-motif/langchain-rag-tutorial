Me towords Victoria: "I won't be free until I fix you." 
This is dangerous because I have a core belief that I'm obligated to fix another human being. 

Dualism
Zorastrianisn, manicheism, gnosticism 

A history of the world's religions:

1. Animism - "I'm a part of this world."
2. Polytheism - "I own my part of the world, but I could use some help." 
3. Monotheism - "I own the whole world."
4. Dualism - "Wait how do I explain evil and an omnipotent God?'
5. Natural Law - "Even God must follow rules."
6. "Monotheism" - "An infinite God is too unrelatable. I miss polytheism... So I'll turn them into saints and holidays!"
7. Ideologies - "None of the previous answers made sense so I'll just make up whatever solves my immediate problems."

A history of belief and meaning. 

Shared narratives allowed us to transcend the physical constraints of communication and unified us into larger and larger collectives of shared [[purpose]].

A History of Belief, Meaning, and [[Purpose]]

Throughout history, humans have used stories to understand ourselves, each other, and the universe. Here's a brief story of the journey so far:


1. Animism - "I'm a part of this world. "Example: [[Shamanism]] - Practices found in indigenous tribes where the natural world is imbued with [[spirits]], and shamans act as intermediaries.
2. Polytheism - "I own my part of the world, but I could use some help."Example: Greek [[Mythology]] - Belief in multiple gods like Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon, each controlling different aspects of the world and life.
3. Monotheism - "I own the whole world."Example: Judaism - Belief in a single, all-powerful God who is the creator and ruler of the universe.
4. Dualism - "Wait, how do I explain evil and an omnipotent God?"Example: Zoroastrianism - Belief in two opposing forces: Ahura Mazda (good) and Angra Mainyu (evil), explaining the presence of both good and evil in the world.
5. Natural Law - "Even God must follow rules. "Example: Stoicism - Belief that the universe is governed by rational and natural laws that even divine beings must adhere to. Living in accordance with these natural laws leads to a virtuous and fulfilling life. 
6. "Monotheism" - "An infinite God is too unrelatable. I miss polytheism... So I'll turn them into saints and holidays! "Example: Catholicism - Incorporation of saints, each associated with specific aspects of life or miracles, resembling the polytheistic gods of old.
7. Ideologies - "None of the previous answers made sense, so I'll just make up whatever solves my immediate problems." Example: Secular Humanism - A worldview that emphasizes human reason, ethics, and justice while explicitly rejecting religious beliefs. It focuses on human well-being and the importance of critical thinking and evidence-based understanding.
8. ??? - The future evolution of belief systems. Example: [[Transhumanism]] - A movement that advocates for the [[transformation]] of the human condition through advanced technology, potentially leading to new forms of belief or [[spirituality]].

Each step represents a different way of understanding and interacting with the world, reflecting the evolving human quest for meaning and understanding.
