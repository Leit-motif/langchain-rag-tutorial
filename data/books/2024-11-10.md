My work [[anxiety]] arises from 2nd grade at St. Edwards. I slipped up due to my [[ADHD]] and my grades were unrecoverable. As a result, school was an unbearable build up of [[anxiety]], of my impending doom. When I finally got my report card, it was as brutal if not more so than I feared. My [[mother]] was tyrant. 

I'm frustrated because I know all of this logically, however the [[emotion]] is stuck, it keeps repeating. I don't know how to resolve it. I then remembered that all I have to do is feel it, however I have trouble remembering what it even felt like as I've repressed the memories. So I have to  simulate, reconstruct, or somehow reexperience the [[memory]]. It's incredibly frustrating.



I find myself feeling guilty for consuming food related content. It's masturbatory. I recognize that I will need to start working on producing things of value soon, as I won't have any other options.


I cancelled my Cursor subscription today. I figured that I will renew it when I have a reason to, a [[purpose]] to fulfill. Part of me feels like I'm quitting, however another part of me reassures that I still have access to my ChatGPT  subscription.
