# Journal

Today I set up my Omi.

I spoke with Caitlin, I was surprisingly calm. I realized that my work situation is more tolerable than it initially seemed, so I'm not going to leave immediately. At the very least, I will respond, not react. 

I'm worried because I found that as soon as the stress, insecurity and threat diminished, I found myself wanting to slump, to get comfortable, stop pushing, stop grinding. I don't want to keep this dynamic. I don't want life to force me to grow by the sword. I'd rather grow on my own by choice. It means temperance. It means choosing my suffering willingly, strategically, instead of having it forced on me in a lump sum payment in cycles.

I spoke with Kristen, and we were friendly during our meeting. She told me that HR has no idea what PowerBI even is. It makes me so sad. I found myself wishing I worked there, because the opportunity is much  greater. There are so many people to impress.
