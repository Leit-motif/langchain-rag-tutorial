# Daily Law
## The Fake Traditionalist

> He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a state, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different from the old ones.
> 
> â€”NiccolÃ² Machiavelli

[[Machiavelli]]

A strategy the clever nonplayer uses to disguise change: making a loud and public display of support for the [[values]] of the past. Renaissance Florence had a centuries-old republic and was suspicious of anyone who flouted its traditions. Cosimo deâ€™ Medici made a show of enthusiastic support for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance of a republic; in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly enacted a radical change, while appearing to safeguard tradition.

> Daily Law: Donâ€™t let the person who seems to be a zealot for tradition fool you. Notice how unconventional they really are.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Reflect on a time when you received a sincere apology.

I canâ€™t recall a time where I received a sincere apology. [[Victoria]] comes to mind however those apologies felt coerced so I have a hard time feeling their [[authenticity]]. I threatened that poor woman so many times. The threat of me leaving kept her in a constant state of fear. It caused her physical symptoms. The threat of [[rejection]] kept her in perpetual agony. She apologized for so much, but it was coerced. I feel bad nowâ€¦

# [[Purpose]]
I need to establish a path. Iâ€™ve been direction less.

## What do you want out of life?

I want the [[power]] to free myself. 
I want the [[power]] to realize my dreams, execute my [[vision]].
I want the [[power]] to create my family. The wife and possibly children that Iâ€™ve always dreamed of. My home. I want the [[power]] to create my home.

So first, I want freedom.
Next I want to a home.
Last, I want to execute my [[vision]], to create. To grow. To fulfill my [[purpose]].

Essentially I just want the [[power]] to climb Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs.

In the context of business, making informed decisions through a combination of quantitative data analysis, data visualization, and deep modeling techniques.

# [[Communication]]
Is iterative.

# [[Identity]]

Is what I do a direct reflection of what I am?

Narratives have gravity.

# [Laws of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/live/tGnSJ6X1FZQ)
[[Owen Cook]]

1. You are the shit just because you are the shit. No other qualifier. You are 1 of 1. Not ?/10.
	1. Even if you were born a 10, there are other 10s you couldn't have. They would reject you. You would still know the [[pain]] of [[rejection]].
2. There is no [[happiness]] outside of yourself.ðŸ’¯l [[Happiness]] can only come from within.
3. The universe is abundant. Don't keep all your eggs in one basket 

# [[Entrepreneurship]]
There's no such thing as employees, you just only have one client. -[[Owen Cook]]

You [[conviction]] must outweigh their skepticism.
