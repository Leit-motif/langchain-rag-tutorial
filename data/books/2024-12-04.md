Person A spends their entire day reminiscing about the past, on their past achievements. They feel like they don't get enough recognition for their past achievements, despite their current circumstances being unproductive and dismal. Person B is Person A's son. He blames his father for having terrible traits, such as escaping into the past for making up for their lack of current achievements amongst their many foibles. Person B laments that he has inherited all of Person A's bad traits, and that there aren't any good traits to inherit. He spends his entire day cursing his ancestry, where he came from, his foundation, his childhood, for his circumstances in the present, for him not being strong enough to pull himself up from his own bootstraps. He feels that only those with favorable upbringings, favorable environments, and favorable genetic predispositions are equipped to thrive in this cruel world. Are one or both of these views deterministic. Psychoanalyze these two people? Do they suffer from the same malady, but with differing expressions? What would Carl Jung say to Person B as advice?

Both Person A and Person B’s views are deterministic in their essence, though expressed in different ways. Let’s break this down and psychoanalyze their respective mindsets, explore their shared malady, and consider how Carl Jung might respond, particularly to Person B.

### **Analysis of Person A**

- **Deterministic Thinking**:  
    Person A is trapped in a cycle of nostalgia, which serves as a defense mechanism against the pain of their current unproductive state. Their focus on the past implies a fatalistic resignation to their present circumstances, as if their best days are behind them and nothing in the present or future can equal their past achievements. This outlook is deterministic because it assumes their identity and value are irreversibly tied to their prior successes.
    
- **Psychoanalysis**:  
    Person A appears to suffer from a form of _stagnation,_ as described by Erik Erikson's psychosocial stages of development. They may be stuck in a midlife or later-life crisis, unable to reconcile their former self with their current self. This gap between their idealized past and dismal present could lead to feelings of worthlessness and bitterness, with a projection of blame onto others for not recognizing their achievements.

### **Analysis of Person B**

- **Deterministic Thinking**:  
    Person B blames their ancestry, environment, and genetics for their perceived inability to thrive. This worldview assumes that their circumstances and personal traits are immutable, leaving them powerless to change their trajectory. The belief that "only the fortunate thrive" dismisses the possibility of personal growth or agency.
    
- **Psychoanalysis**:  
    Person B displays symptoms of _learned helplessness,_ a psychological state where repeated experiences of powerlessness lead to a pervasive belief that efforts to change are futile. Their focus on blaming their father and circumstances might stem from a deep resentment or unprocessed grief, reflecting a Jungian "shadow projection." By externalizing blame, they avoid confronting their own responsibility and potential for transformation.

### **Shared Malady**

Both individuals are caught in deterministic loops that prevent growth:

1. **Person A:** Escapes into the past, unable to integrate their past self with their present.
2. **Person B:** Dwells on external causes for their misery, using them as justification for stagnation.

At their core, both suffer from a lack of _self-actualization_ and an inability to confront and transform their internal narratives. Both avoid present engagement—Person A avoids it by clinging to the past, while Person B avoids it by blaming the past.

### **What Would Carl Jung Say to Person B?**

Carl Jung might offer the following advice to Person B:

1. **Acknowledge the Shadow**:  
    Jung would encourage Person B to confront their resentment and negativity toward their father (_Person A_) as part of their own shadow. Recognizing that these traits exist within themselves is the first step to integration. Jung might say:  
    _“What you resist not only persists, but will grow in size. The traits you despise in your father live within you. Until you own them, they will control you.”_
    
2. **Individuation Process**:  
    Jung would likely urge Person B to embark on the path of individuation—the process of becoming their true self, independent of their father's influence. This involves distinguishing between inherited patterns and their authentic identity.  
    _“Your task is not to blame your inheritance, but to transcend it. What you are is your potential, not your limitation.”_
    
3. **Symbolism of Transformation**:  
    Jung might suggest reframing their struggles symbolically, viewing their "ancestral baggage" as raw material for their hero’s journey. He might encourage Person B to find meaning in their suffering as a crucible for growth.  
    _“The gold you seek lies within the mud you abhor. Alchemy is the art of transforming base material into the divine.”_
    
4. **Living in the Present**:  
    Jung would emphasize the importance of present engagement over fixation on the past:  
    _“The past is a foundation, not a prison. Build upon it, but do not remain bound by it.”_

### **Conclusion**

Person A and Person B suffer from the same malady: a deterministic view of life rooted in disconnection from the present and avoidance of responsibility. While Person A idolizes a past that no longer serves them, Person B demonizes a past they cannot change. Jung’s advice would be to confront their shadows, integrate their experiences, and embrace the present moment as a field of potential transformation.
