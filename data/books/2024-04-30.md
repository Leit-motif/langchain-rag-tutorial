# Daily Law
## Never Appear Too Perfect

> It takes great talent and skill to conceal one’s talent and skill.
> 
> —François de La Rochefoucauld

Sir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court of Queen Elizabeth of England. He had skills as a scientist, wrote poetry still recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time, was a proven leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea captain, and on top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who charmed his way into becoming one of the queen’s favorites. Wherever he went, however, people blocked his path. Eventually he suffered a terrific fall from [[grace]], leading even to prison and finally the executioner’s axe. *Raleigh could not understand the stubborn opposition he faced from the other courtiers. He did not see that he had not only made no attempt to disguise the degree of his skills and qualities, but he had imposed them on one and all, making a show of his versatility, thinking it impressed people and won him friends. In fact it made him silent enemies*, **people who felt inferior to him** and did all they could to ruin him the moment he tripped up or made the slightest mistake. In the end, the reason he was executed was treason, but envy will use any cover it finds to mask its destructiveness.

> Daily Law: Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. Defuse it by occasionally downplaying your virtues.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Write about a time when you felt inspired by a role model.

# Morning Page
Today I woke up tired, having woken up multiple times
during the night, including laying awake for an hour, however, according to my
sleep tracker, I got "excellent" sleep. I decided that I will goto the
gym for a cardio session after all. I feel [[guilt]] over not using my work day
efficiently. I could have used this dead time better however I just wasn't
in the headspace to do so. I've lacked an overarching goal, a direction,
a through line. In the shower, I realized that part of me is like a
hobbit, I just want to sleep and eat and expend as little effort
as possible. This person is in stark contrast to the executor persona
I am building, envisioning, remembering. I am curious which are
innate, and which are learned, acquired. Will I be happy with a
life of bustling activity, day after day, with no breathing room. This is
the life I am chasing, is it not A good question, a valid concern
however this is a false dichotomy. There's a middle ground, a
gradient, and possibly third or more options. Busy-ness does not
equal productivity. I can build a life of alternating bursts of activity
followed by moments of repose.Seasons. Life need not be a Single
mode, but a patchwork of different states, woven together to
meet all of my needs. for now I will continue with my time audit
and find how I can maximize my day job in order to work
towards [[financial freedom]].

# Metformin 
Hi Dr Unjom. I forgot to ask this during our previous visit, but insulin is also a hormone so perhaps you can advise. My last few fasting glucose readings show me at the upper border of normal (95-99). I feel that given my controlled diet and exercise, that this is still too high. I feel that perhaps it's a genetic predisposition as I have/had family with diabetes or prediabetes.

I would like to consider starting Metformin? Please advise.

# Fiction vs Non-fiction
Today I spoke with Reid and he remarked that I was eloquent with speaking and he imagined that it would translate well to writing. He remarked that while he thought that fiction was a fine calling, he would think I would do more for the world by writing non-fiction. I found that to be a valid take however I countered that while I may also write non-fiction, I find fiction to be more appealing. I then cited one of the reasons being plausible deniability. Earlier, we were talking about [[Niccolo Machiavelli]] and I found it be the perfect example of how [[writing]] fiction is utilitarian, not simply indulgent. I stated that had he wrote his ideas directly, it would have negatively impacted his public image. Writing the work as fiction gave him plausible deniability. I later thought of more justifications for choosing to write fiction:

1. Plausible deniability
2. Fiction paints a picture of what could be, it is right-brained, it is creative. A picture is worth a thousand words. Non-fiction requires sticking to words as it is descriptive and analytical, it is left-brained.
3. Suspension of disbelief: fiction allows one to suspend disbelief long enough to entertain a train of thought that begins with a thought contrary to established belief. E.g. in a geocentric world-view, heliocentrism was not entertained because it was contrary to the established basic maxim of the biblical depiction of the universe’s creation. No one one would even begin to question an alternative because it violated the basic premise that God created the universe in a specific way and obviously the Bible is correct.

# [[Chitta]]
_Chitta_ is one of the four aspects of consciousness. The aspect of _chitta_ allows for subjectivity, one’s emotional reaction, affected by what it sees and its own nature. For example, if a bitter Taste affects one negatively, then one’s perception of a bitter tasting fruit will be negative. [(2)](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/[[chitta]]/#footnote-2 "Demystifying [[Patanjali]], Swami Kriyananda. The Fourth Book, “Kaivalya Pada.”") The other three aspects of mind are _manas_ (perceiving mind) _buddhi_ (intelligence), and _ahankara_ (ego). [(3)](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/[[chitta]]/#footnote-3 "God Is for Everyone, by Swami Kriyananda. Chapter 10, “The Science of [[Religion]].”")

In various translations of the [[yoga]] sutras, _chitta_ is sometimes defined as “mind-stuff” [(4)](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/[[chitta]]/#footnote-4 "The [[Yoga]] Sutras of [[Patanjali]], James Haughton Woods. Book I, “Concentration or Samadhi.”") or “the lower mind.” [(5)](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/[[chitta]]/#footnote-5 "A Commentary on the Voice of Silence, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Annie Besant. Chapter 3, “The Slayer of the Real.”") However, according to [Swami Kriyananda](https://www.ananda.org/about-ananda-sangha/swami-kriyananda/) “feeling” is a more precise translation because feeling can go either outward to [ego consciousness](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/ahankara/), which creates lower aspects of the mind, or inward and upward to higher consciousness qualities like [[self]]-control, devotion, and calmness.

[[Patanjali]] says that [[yoga]] “neutralizes” or calms _chitta_, rather than destroying it. [[Yoga]] results in the experience of the vortices of feeling — whirlpools of desire and attachment — as a calm ocean of feeling. This stills the mind and allows one to perceive God. [(6)](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/[[chitta]]/#footnote-6 "Demystifying [[Patanjali]], Swami Kriyananda. The First Book, “Samadhi Pada.”") In the body, _chitta_ is centered in the heart. [(7)](https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/[[chitta]]/#footnote-7 "Demystifying [[Patanjali]], by Swami Kriyananda. Book 1, Sutra 2, “[[Yoga]] is the neutralization of the vortices of feeling.”")

# [[Individuation]]
## [[Mana Personality]]
The “[[Mana Personality]]” is a term coined by [[Carl Jung]], a prominent figure in the field of analytical [[psychology]]. It refers to an aspect of the psyche that embodies extraordinary powers and qualities. The term “mana” originates from Melanesian culture, where it refers to a bewitching or [[numinous]] quality in gods and sacred objects3.

In Jungian [[psychology]], a mana-personality is seen as a personified archetypal image of a supernatural force. It’s often associated with figures of great [[power]] or influence, such as a hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, or a ruler of men and [[spirits]]. Historically, the mana-personality evolves into the hero and the godlike being, whose earthly form is the priest.

In the context of individual [[psychology]], Jung used the concept of mana-personality to describe the inflationary effect of assimilating autonomous unconscious contents, particularly those associated with the [[anima]] and [[animus]]. This process can lead to a sense of inflated [[self]]-importance, as the ego feels as though it has appropriated something that does not belong to it.

However, Jung emphasized that this sense of importance or “mana” does not work on others because the ego has not truly conquered the [[anima]] or [[animus]], but has merely become adulterated with an archetype, another unconscious figure. Therefore, the perceived importance is not real, but rather a result of this adulteration.

## Next step: confrontation with the [[anima]]/[[animus]]
After the mana figure, the next step in Carl Jung’s [[individuation]] process is the **confrontation with the [[anima]] or [[animus]]**.

The [[anima]] represents a man’s femininity and generally speaking his emotional side. The [[anima]] archetype controls the relationship between man and woman in different stages, from the mother-son relationship to the marriage. For women, this step involves confrontation with the [[animus]], which represents masculine aspects.

This stage is crucial as it involves acknowledging and integrating these gendered archetypes, which are typically unconscious, into one’s conscious [[self]]. This process can lead to a more balanced and whole sense of [[self]].

It’s important to note that the [[individuation]] process is unique to each individual and can vary greatly in its progression. The ultimate goal of [[individuation]], according to Jung, is to become a unique, total human being.

## Encounter with the archetype of the Wise Old Man
The next step in the [[individuation]] process after the confrontation with the [[anima]] or [[animus]] is the **encounter with the archetype of the Wise Old Man**². 

This image embodies our inherent [[wisdom]], meaning, and significance; it represents the spirit or the spiritual². The Wise Old Man can symbolize a distinct way of thinking, completely unknown to the ego, a universal and timeless wisdom². This archetype can manifest itself in challenging times in life (which trigger the [[individuation]] process) and essentially offers a bridge from the initial difficulty to a balanced state, felt as salvation².

The Wise Old Man can take various forms in our dreams, such as a guru (Buddha, Ramana Maharshi), professor (Albert Einstein), doctor (Sigmund Freud), priest (Albert Schweitzer), etc., essentially any public figure with authority, offering advice or teachings².

Remember, the [[individuation]] process is unique to each individual and can vary greatly in its progression¹. The ultimate goal of [[individuation]], according to Jung, is to become a unique, total human being¹.
