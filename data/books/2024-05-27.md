# Daily Law
## Detect Their True Motives

> Knowing any man’s mainspring of motive, you have, as it were, the key to his will.
> 
> —Baltasar Gracián

In the Machiavellian perspective, few events in public life are rarely what they seem to be. [[Power]] depends on appearances, on manipulating what the public sees. On seeming good, while doing what is necessary to gain and maintain [[power]]. Sometimes it is easy to see through the fog and pick out people’s motives or intentions. But usually, it is quite complicated—what is really going on, we ask ourselves? In the new media [[environment]], the ability to create fog and confusion has been greatly enhanced. Stories and rumors can be planted with virtually no source behind them. The story will spread virally. Before people begin to question the validity of story A, their attention is distracted by something else, story B or C; in the meantime, story A takes root in people’s minds in subtle ways. It is an added layer of [[uncertainty]] and [[doubt]] that makes it quite easy for all kinds of insinuation games. To decipher events that seem hard to read, I sometimes rely on a strategy that comes from the Latin _Cui bono?_ It was first used in this context by Cicero and it literally translates to, “For whose good, or benefit?” It means: when you are trying to figure out the motives behind some murky action, look to see whom it really benefits in the end, and then work backward. [[Self]]-interest rules the world.

> Daily Law: Don’t be fooled by appearances, by what happens, by what people do and say. Always ask: _Cui bono?_

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Express gratitude for the [[beauty]] of the changing seasons.

I’m so happy that summer is coming. I never realized how much I appreciated the sunlight and fresh air. I [[love]] walking without worrying about the wind. 

When fall comes around, I am happy that the weather starts to cool and allows me to start wearing layers. I [[love]] the changing colors of the trees. I [[love]] that the weather becomes temperate. 

# Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation
[[Indecision]], [[regret]]
Rudeus doesn’t want to make decisions without having information. The god of man tells him that everyone makes decisions in the dark and that he is being greedy by asking for more than what most people get. The god of man gets Rudeus to realize that [[regret]] is inevitable no matter what choice we make.

# [Hypostasis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostasis_(philosophy_and_religion)>)

The underlying state or underlying substance and is the fundamental [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality") that supports all else. But it is not the same as the concept of a substance.

# Acrimonious

Angry or bitter.

# Pluto

Perhaps my ruling planet is Pluto. I am obsessed with Plutonian themes such as [[transformation]] and [[power]]. 

Eye Contact, The Look

It's my experience with my parents when they were mad at me and gave me the look does that transfer to me projecting that on everyone as if they are giving me the look and therefore I heard my gaze?

[[Self]] pathologizing vivisection. 

Unconditional positive regard to words my [[inner child]]. 

Persists Environmental danger necessitates an overgrowth of the [[superego]]. The [[superego]] attempts to learn the parents’ rules, to a level of perfection, to gain the parents’ approval and [[acceptance]]. The inner critic is the [[superego]] gone toxic. It [[self]] hates disgust abandons you, blaming your shortcomings as the cause for them abandoning you. 

Tormented by hypervigilance combined with normal environmental pressures. It's too much to bear. There's no room for a healthy ego to develop, too much friction, so the [[superego]] takes over. It owns the parent’s “You're a bad boy” into “I'm a bad boy”.

14 inner critic attacks
Perfectionism is a maladaptation. Every mistake is an opportunity for me to practice loving myself in the places I've never been loved

Black or white thinking. This is slippery slope, exaggeration, histrionics. Always or never statements are grossly inaccurate. 

Toxic [[shame]]. I commit to myself that I am on my side. 

I turn [[shame]] into back into blame and disgust and externalize it back onto whoever shamed my normal frelings and foibles.

# Entropy

Is the measure of disorder within a system.
