[[Puer Aeternus]]
Sometimes, we must experience severe [[self]] inflicted harm before they can truly awaken to the reality of life. It's because of how unconscious we are. How imbalanced the inner and outer worlds are weighted. The dizziness of [[freedom]]. [[Kierkegaard]]. Losing oneself in the finite, or becoming paralyzed by optionality. As the puer wrestles with this [[freedom]], they succumb to laziness, retreating into [[depression]] to cope with the burden of choice. They know they're [[failure]] stems from laziness. Yet they cannot will themselves out of it. 

Overthinking leads to confusion and inaction. Act. By refusing the call to [[adventure]] the puer remains trapped in stagnation.

You want to go your individual way...

Reduce dependencies. Inner and outer.

A [[father]] does not create the same role of dependency. 
A [[father]]'s role is to protect, provide resources, and most importantly, guidance. A fathers role is to break dependency on the [[mother]] , guiding them to be an independent and functional adult. Being a [[father]] role requires strength, [[independence]], and emotional presence.

We must confront our inner dependencies.

We chase initiation proxies that are terrifying and thrilling, such as wanting to be a soldier, or being on the show Survivor. Representing a deep psychological archetype activating within them, guiding them through life. 

If a child enters adulthood with a strong [[mother]] complex, they may avoid developing [[independence]] or [[consciousness]], instead becoming gripped by "the spirit of regression". This spirit binds them to the [[mother]], threatening them with dissolution and extinction in the unconscious. 

Dreams play a pivotal role in integrating the Puer. When the [[inner child]] appears in dreams, it holds a dual significance. It is both behind and ahead of us. Behind us the infantile shadow urges us towards dependency, laziness, and the escape from life's responsibilities. To step into the role of the hero, this shadow must be sacrificed. Ahead of us, the child-[[god]] stands as a beacon of renewal, symbolizing the limitless potential for [[growth]], and the ever expanding journey of life. 

Dreams are the gateway to the unconscious, and the key to integration. However, I must be able to remember my dreams first before I'm able to work with them. Manifesting these dreams into art amplifies their [[energy]] and message. Integrate them by active imagination, and into our daily lives. 

Whatever One has within themselves but does not live grows against them.

The pure dreams Big, the cenex works hard. 

# [[emotion]]


# My ancestry
My ancestry is dead weight, and I want to be rid of it.

# Mark Manson Job posting
It happened again. I saw an opportunity. An actual tangible avenue (however slim the chances) that I could pursue a dream that I wanted. A path. And it even warned to not dawdle. And what did I do? I dawdled. I missed the deadline which was yesterday. I had my chance and I blew it because I didn't take it seriously enough. I didn't put my all into it. Because I'm stuck in my [[pain]], in my pleasure, in the reverie la-la land of the [[Puer Aeternus]]. In the end, I was happy to live in limbo rather than take the meager action that's required of me. Just like the [[writing]] the article from Eric. I have a tangible path, I deprioritize it at the first hint of [[adversity]] or friction. This is my [[Puer Aeternus]] wound. I am weak willed. I don't know how to persist. Until I learn [[resilience]], I will have nothing. Who knows how many opportunities I've let slip through my fingers?! This [[Mark Manson]] post was vague, it involved work, but I had told myself that I would put in the effort. It was something that would leverage my psych degree, it was something I was at least tangentially interested in, and it is based on Los Angeles. I was going to be able to work with one of my heroes. This could have been everything. The job description almost seemed tailored to me. I sensed destiny, yet I looked the other way. I buried my head in the sand, instead focusing on my constraints all day and all night, instead of the opportunities and actions that I could take to free myself. I focused so much on my shackles, that I ignored the key hiding in plain sight, and now it's gone. I don't know whether I would have made it through all of the recruitment. Sure, I feel a sense of destiny, however that could just be delusions of grandeur. What is truly lost here is [[trust]] in myself to follow through with the opportunities around me. I need to [[trust]] that when opportunity presents itself, I am ready to take massive action. I need to [[trust]] that I'll take care of this family, as the head of the household. And I am not a good [[father]], a good head of the household to my internal family system (IFS). There is no way to determine that this was the right path for me, I truly don't know. There's no sense in assuming that it would've all went through had I just started the process. That's just as much magical thinking as assuming that this will be the only opportunity that will present itself for the foreseeable future. The only thing I can assume, that is a matter of fact, is that whatever is meant for me will present itself to me, and that it can only be that way. It can't be any other way. This scenario happened to reveal to me a [[growth]] opportunity. To pay the fuck [[attention]] to my [[environment]], to opportunity, not to my [[pain]], not to my hunger. This is like focusing on a hungry belly instead of being vigilant for wandering prey or scavenging opportunities.

When something resonates with you, you need to listen to your intuition and act. That is the lesson that your [[father]] is teaching you, how not to act. Normally a [[father]] should guide on how to act, but for you, things are reversed, as you understand well enough by now. You have started live with internal exploration, and may end up living an external life in your second half. 

The worst part about this is that I did my job applications yesterday, however I didn't follow through with discipline, with [[structure]], with order. I followed wherever my whims took me, even if it was in the name of work, it wasn't structurally prioritize. I should have been following a first-in-first-out approach to prioritization. The enemy here is procrastination, of laziness, of lacking earnestness, of being complacent. Complacency is my enemy. It is a false complacency, born of illusion. This is the last [[time]] I can allow this. This complacency is an [[emotion]] that arises from...laziness? It has cost me too much in life. It cost me my grades in school. It cost me an early job opportunity at a cigarette store. Even my disability underwriter job perhaps. Upon reflection, at least for the cigarette store, and possibly the school work, it arose from a false sense of superiority, of underestimating the task before me due to an overestimation of my ability and worth. It arises from ego, arrogance, hubris, conceit, overconfidence, pretentiousness even. It is vanity. My vanity has cost me yet again. This vanity arises from the Puer's fantasy world where I imagine myself king of the world. Because I have inflated my [[self]]-worth so greatly, it causes me to underestimate the world around me. It's not that I'm not up to the task, this is purely a misallocation of resources. A fault in [[judgement]]. 

Why did I deprioritize this opportunity in the first place. I was initially smitten by how on the nose this opportunity was. Then...I read all of the requirements, the adversities, the barriers, the unfeasibility of me actually getting the job, the pessimism, the fact that this was meant for young professionals as a stepping stone (I now realize this may have been code for "we won't compensate you fairly"), my doubts and fears regarding my skills in actuality, as I secretly admit that I live in the fantasy world of potential, and that my real skills are lacking. Pessimism and over-analysis prevented me from acting. Thinking prevented me from taking the next step. 

I feared both that I wasn't good enough but also that this might actually come true and it would mean change. I am sabotaging myself and I need help.

# Tarot Question
"What will be the impact on my future goal of moving to a metropolitan city if I move out of my parents' home now versus staying to save money?"


I performed a 3-card spread: My question: "What will be the impact on my mental health, and my future goal of moving to a metropolitan city if I move out of my parents' home now versus wait for opportunity to present itself before moving?" card 1: 3 of swords card 2: 7 of pentacles card 3: 8 of swords

Here’s what the 3-card spread reveals for your question about moving to a metropolitan city versus waiting for the opportunity:

1. **Past – 3 of Swords**  
    
    The 3 of Swords represents past heartbreak, [[pain]], or a difficult situation that has impacted you emotionally. It suggests that past emotional wounds or fears might be playing a significant role in your hesitation. This card highlights emotional challenges that may have been tied to your current living situation or concerns about stepping away from family comfort.
    
2. **Present – 7 of Pentacles**  
    
    In the present, the 7 of Pentacles indicates that you are reflecting on the effort you've put into your goals and whether the timing is right to make a move. This card encourages patience and assessment, showing that you are currently in a phase of re-evaluating your choices and waiting to see the long-term results before making a major decision. This may signify hesitation to act immediately and a need to wait for the right opportunity or for the seeds you have planted to grow.
    
3. **Future – 8 of Swords**  
    
    The 8 of Swords represents feeling trapped or restricted, but mostly by your own perceptions or fears. It suggests that moving to a metropolitan city might make you feel overwhelmed or stuck if you don’t address the mental limitations and anxieties you currently have. It warns of a possible future where you feel mentally constrained by [[fear]], unable to move forward if you don't resolve internal doubts.
    

### Conclusion:

This spread suggests that while you’ve experienced emotional [[pain]] (3 of Swords), now is a [[time]] for careful evaluation and patience (7 of Pentacles). Rushing into a decision may lead to feelings of restriction or [[self]]-imposed limitations in the future (8 of Swords). The cards encourage you to address your fears and take a balanced approach rather than making an impulsive decision. [[Focus]] on internal clarity to ensure you're mentally prepared for a change when the [[time]] comes.
