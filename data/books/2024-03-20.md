# Daily [[Gratitude]]

# Ep. 15 Plotinus
#PhilosophizeThis 
- Humans fear irreversibility ([[Death]]).
- Humans feel as aliens in this life. We suddenly incarnate into a world of suffering. We feel that we don't belong here. True world religions offer relief from this feeling. 
- [[Religion]] and [[philosophy]] both aim to alleviate this [[pain]] however [[philosophy]] aims to do it through only the tools we are given in this world.
- For [[philosophy]], physical and metaphysical understanding helps us to orient where we are in the universe so have we can begin to reason what we should do.
- During Plotinus' time, Christianity offered the most utility as a relief from this suffering through personal salvation, and an interventionist and (imminent?) God. 
- Plotinus' early life resembled Harry Potter.
- Evil (or in Greek, "all bad things") arise from the absence of good rather than existing in and of themselves.
- Unity, oneness, is an aspect that denotes evolution.
- His fountain theory: at the top was the "One", indescribable, the second tier is mind, and the third tier is "soul", what is in the world. Tier 2 is the world of Forms. 
- The world is a reflection (tier 3) of a reflection (tier 2).

# The Weakest Tamer Began a Journey to Pick Up Trash
The gods don't play fair. To be given nothing by [[fate]]. To be punished for having nothing. The world wants you gone because you're of no use. What is the [[purpose]] of a useless person? An ungifted person. 

She has no stars but she does have memories of her past life. They aren't useful and manifest as an voice in her head that is not direct, only responds.

If the world doesn't want you, is there nothing you can do about it?

I am now the plant that thrives after being stomped on, my name is Ivy. 

Mana and vitality are the same resource. [[Energy]]

More important than place, is people ([[Relationships]]). Find those you can [[Trust]], and once you have, tell them everything. Everything we hide away in the darkness, always comes to light, and when it does, we need the support of those who will accept our deepest [[truth]], but we can never open their eyes to begin with.
# You use beautiful people as a means rather than an end to themselves.
You use them as a means to your excitement, pleasure, biologically directed attention (dopamine response), and lust. You then feel guilty, as if you have stolen something from them. That makes it hard to look them in the eyes. You took something of theirs but didn't offer anything in return because once again, at the center of this, you have been using yourself as a means to these same ends. If you treat others as ends, you will also learn to treat yourself as an end.
