People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of their character. --Ralph Waldo Emerson

Intractable - hard to deal with.

Bayes' Theorem

Conjugated - connected 

Scorpio season is here to remind us that no matter who we are, we deserve to be fully seen and fully loved, by ourselves. Because if you don’t embrace every part of who you are—the dark, the light, the good, and the bad—and see yourself as the love of your own life, you’ll always be waiting for someone else to fill that role. 

Strip away the duality and all that's left is the one sword held high to the sky. There's only one option and it is aligned with the sky, the upright sword held high. 

Emotion
The initial feeling isn't a choice but what happens next, your relationship with that emotion, offers space for personal agency.
