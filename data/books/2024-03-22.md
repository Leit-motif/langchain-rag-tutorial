# Tablet woes
I don't like that it's down here. But even with Gboard, there's still the issue of ???. This just won't do. I'm sad because I will probably end up returning this as well.. This sucks!

I would feel better if there was an app that could interface with this This doesn't let me see what I am writing interestingly This does feel interesting if I only look at the text and not my hand writing.

I now will test Samsung Notes.

This is just too forced.
Does this even feel good?
I can't write with this however I can diagram.
It doesn't even export in dark mode.

I can write out a quick note here and then convert it
into text.

I am testing out the keyboard. It feels good to use this with a Bluetooth keyboard however I am just unsure as to why I am using this as opposed to my desktop? It seems redundant. I don't understand why I need a tablet. It seems forced and a $700 price tag is a lot of money to force. Therefore it seems that this doesn't make sense as a writing device. 

I can still draw with this tablet. That means diagramming. Anything that is not straight text which is just so much more efficient on a keyboard. It's too hard to justify. 

With a Wi-Fi adapter, I can use the tablet as another screen.

Media consumption. Especially in a more comfortable setting than my desk chair. At some point it's feasible that I will have a comfy couch or that my bed will have a headrest. I am not stuck to this current life forever. 

PDF e-reader. I am unsure whether this tablet is simply too large however I feel that this could be an expensive e-reader that also allows for pdf annotation. 

so I have handwritten notes in Samsung Notes. This app
.
works but I am not sure how practical this solution is.
I [[love]] that the light glare is right above my head. I am testing
writing in my hand. The tablet is pretty heavy. I just need to write
out a lot of stuff.
5. Let's try out an outline.
A- Item A
B. Item B
1. Sub-item I
2. sub-item 2
a. Sub-sub-item a.
.
My back curves when writing as opposed to typing, but there's
something that feels nice about just sitting and writing. This feels
relaxing whereas typing makes me feel as if I am standing at
attention.
While I was a bit upset before, I realize now that I would
rarely if ever swap between typing and writing so the Samsung
Notes vs. [[obsidian]] is less offensive. I also realize that I can
use two apps due to the screen size.

I like the landscape made as well. I can use this
for capture or I can type directly if I have my
BT keyboard with me. I think a tablet is suitable
as a laptop replacement for someone who already uses
a desktop.
