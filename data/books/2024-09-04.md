# Depression
I'm depressed. It's why I'm craving so many sweets. I'm craving drugs. My [[motivation]] is depleted. It's because I don't feel I have a way forward anymore. I was getting excited about change, but now I'm stuck until the new year, and I secretly don't [[trust]] that I will follow through with my [[conviction]]. It's too big of a [[transformation]].

# Focus

Multi scale [[time]] blocking. Yearly, quarterly, weekly, daily [[time]] blocking. Funnel. 

Reduce context switching .
