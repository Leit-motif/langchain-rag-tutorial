# Journal

Kendra - I am supposed to stay away from the battle because if I destroy her, I will be forced to take her place, and tied to a cause I don't care about. I will feel responsible, indebted to Pavi or whoever assigns me the role.

The most taxing life chapters yield the most long-term [[nostalgia]]. The harder something is, the more you'll appreciate it later. So reframe whatever you "hate" right now as something you will [[love]] & cherish later.
-Nicolas Cole

Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesnâ€™t degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them.

# Shamanism
Spirit animals: My current spirit animal is the red-eyed raven from my dream. I may have had the butterfly as a spirit animal from youth. Now I seek a new spirit animal, the Lion, Tiger, or Dragon. An animal of [[power]].

Being alone was my [[death]], the start of the shamanic journey. These last two years have been the butterfly's pupation, the goopification. It was supposed to take [[time]]. It was supposed to break me down into goop. I am now passed that stage. I have a form. I have built that form, however it's not strong enough to break free from my cocoon. I have tried so many things, however I haven't been able to break the shell. As I write this, I'm reminded of when Lindsay Donaldson peer pressured me into opening my pet butterfly's cocoon before it was ready. I listened to her due to wanting to impress her, my people pleasing, however I was mortified by what I saw. Goop. I remember feeling betrayed. Lindsay had her curiosity sated, however I was left with the catastrophe of trying to save my caterpillar, of undoing my shameful act. I have echoes of that [[memory]] where my intuition told me that it was wrong, that I shouldn't listen to her, but I so desperately wanted to fit in, and paid the ultimate price. I remember the faces of the adults I asked for help wore a grimace of disgust/mixed with feeling sorry for me/pity/as well as a face of "no fucking duh you moron". I have carried this wound into adulthood. That caterpillar was me. Perhaps I've been forced to pay for that caterpillar's second life. 

# Sexual attraction
My problem with my sexual response is that anyone who provokes my response is way out of my league. So I made the choice to ignore my body, and try and find a way to be happy with what I was given. It hasn't worked.

# How to get our needs met
1. Others can't always meet our needs
	1. This is something that we just need to accept
2. We need to be active participants
	1. We can't just rely on others to meet our needs. We can't be passive and expect the world to form itself around us.
3. Build or find a community
	1. Communities are important because it gives us optionality. We can't put our eggs in one basket.
