What are my doubts regarding my career situation?

I did a 3 card spread for the following question: "Give me career guidance regarding how I should proceed at SCJ (the current company I work for)." The cards I drew from Left to Right: 1. 2 of Cups 2. The Tower 3. The Fool (r)

### 1. **2 of Cups (Past/Current Situation)**

The 2 of Cups suggests that you've built strong, meaningful relationships at SCJ. This card is about harmony, partnership, and mutual respect, indicating that collaboration and trust have been key to your current situation. Whether it's with colleagues or superiors, this card signifies that you’ve found allies and possibly shared visions in your work. If you’ve been relying on teamwork, networking, or partnerships, these have been favorable aspects so far.

- **Guidance:** Continue nurturing these connections. Your relationships at work can provide support during challenging times, and teamwork will be a resource moving forward.

### 2. **The Tower (Present Challenge or Change)**

The Tower represents sudden upheaval, breakdowns, or dramatic change. It may indicate that something is currently shifting at SCJ—possibly a significant restructuring, unexpected conflict, or an emotional wake-up call that shakes your foundations. The Tower doesn’t always signify something negative; it often clears the way for breakthroughs by dismantling what is no longer sustainable.

- **Guidance:** Be prepared for disruption. This card advises you to stay grounded while navigating any sudden changes. Let go of outdated methods or perspectives that no longer serve your growth. The Tower wants you to face this breakdown with courage, as it’s likely leading to a transformation you need to progress in your career. Resilience and adaptability are essential now.

### 3. **The Fool (Reversed) – Outcome/Advice**

The Fool reversed signals caution about jumping into something new too hastily. It often points to hesitancy, fear of the unknown, or a potential misstep in a new venture. You may feel uncertain or unprepared to take on a fresh start, or perhaps there's a risk of being overly naive or impulsive about a new direction at SCJ or elsewhere.

- **Guidance:** Be mindful of impulsivity. While change is inevitable (as shown by The Tower), take time to assess your next steps carefully. The Fool reversed suggests you should ground yourself in planning, ensuring you’re not overlooking critical details or risks. Consider this a time to reflect, gather more information, and approach new opportunities with a cautious but open mind. Balance optimism with practicality.

### **Overall Interpretation**

This spread suggests you’re in a phase of significant transition at SCJ. The relationships you’ve formed (2 of Cups) are your anchors, but you’re currently facing upheaval (The Tower) that could reshape your work environment or role. While change is necessary, The Fool reversed warns you to approach it thoughtfully, without rushing into the unknown without preparation.

**Steps you can take:**

- Lean on your relationships and trusted colleagues for support and insight.
- Embrace the changes, but stay grounded and strategic in your responses.
- Avoid rushing into new projects or decisions until you have full clarity.

By moving forward with both openness and care, you'll navigate this shift in your career wisely.


Let's analyze your three-card spread in relation to your career question about how to proceed at SCJ.

1. **The Past - Two of Cups**  
    The Two of Cups represents harmony, partnership, and mutual respect. This card in your past suggests that you have likely built solid relationships and partnerships in your workplace. There may have been a period of cooperation and mutual benefit between you and your colleagues or management. This card indicates that you have been valued and have cultivated a strong professional network at SCJ, making it a supportive environment in the past.
    
2. **The Present - The Tower**  
    The Tower is a powerful card that indicates upheaval, sudden change, and disruption. In your present position, this card suggests that something is dramatically shifting in your work environment or personal career path. This could represent a structural change in the company, a significant project failure, or a personal realization about your career. While the Tower can feel unsettling, it ultimately leads to necessary transformation and growth. It pushes you out of your comfort zone, forcing you to confront uncomfortable truths and take action to rebuild.
    
3. **The Future - The Fool (Reversed)**  
    The Fool in reverse signals hesitation, fear of failure, or reluctance to take risks. In the future, this card suggests that while you may want to take a leap into something new or different in your career, you are held back by fear of the unknown or making mistakes. The reversed Fool advises you to confront these fears directly and reminds you that staying stagnant out of fear of failure can block progress. This is a sign that even though it may seem risky, embracing new opportunities or changes with confidence will lead to personal growth.
    

### Career Guidance:

- **Reflect on the positive relationships** you’ve built at SCJ (Two of Cups). These partnerships can offer support as you navigate any upcoming changes.
- **Prepare for major shifts or disruptions** (The Tower). Don’t resist change, even if it feels chaotic. This period is essential for your professional transformation.
- **Don’t let fear stop you from moving forward** (Reversed Fool). Your hesitation to take risks could prevent you from growing. Face your uncertainties with courage, and trust that taking action will lead you to where you need to be.

This spread suggests that while you have had a strong foundation at SCJ, you are currently in a period of upheaval and need to remain open to new opportunities while managing your fear of change.

Your three-card Tarot spread offers a deep and transformative message regarding your career situation at SC Johnson.

### 1. **2 of Cups (Partnership & Harmony)**

This card suggests that relationships and partnerships are key to your current career. It implies that cooperation, teamwork, and mutual support are essential at SCJ right now. There may be someone in your work environment with whom you can build a stronger partnership or rely on for support. It also indicates that balance and mutual understanding are important as you navigate your situation—perhaps reaching out to an ally or finding common ground with someone could open new doors.

### 2. **The Tower (Sudden Change, Destruction)**

The Tower is a card of upheaval, representing unexpected and possibly painful change. In the context of your career, this could symbolize the collapse of something you’ve built—perhaps the toxic work environment you mentioned or the current structure you’re operating within. While the Tower can feel like destruction, it ultimately clears the way for something new to emerge. This card suggests that change is inevitable at SCJ, and it may feel disruptive, but it’s also an opportunity to rebuild something better. It's important to prepare for this shift, even if it's difficult to anticipate how it will unfold.

### 3. **The Fool (Reversed) (Caution, Hesitation)**

In the reversed position, The Fool signals that fear or hesitation may be holding you back from taking a leap of faith or starting a new journey. There’s a sense of caution—perhaps you are not yet ready to fully embrace the changes or opportunities ahead, or you feel uncertain about what lies beyond SCJ. The Fool reversed warns against rash decisions but also cautions against letting fear paralyze you. It could be asking you to be mindful of overthinking or being overly cautious, which could prevent you from moving forward and embracing new opportunities.

### Interpretation:

This spread speaks to a potential pivotal moment at SCJ. The **2 of Cups** indicates that focusing on partnerships and seeking harmonious relationships could help you navigate the current environment. However, **The Tower** warns of imminent and perhaps unavoidable change, potentially the end of your current role or situation. While this may feel destructive, it’s an opportunity to clear the old and build anew. The **reversed Fool** suggests that you may feel uncertain or hesitant about making a big career change, but it encourages you to find balance between caution and boldness.

If you feel trapped at SCJ, this spread seems to suggest that a significant transformation is on the horizon. While you may be hesitant, the upheaval could ultimately lead you to a more fulfilling path—especially if you focus on building meaningful relationships and not letting fear dictate your next steps.
