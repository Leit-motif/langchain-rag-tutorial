"You can also commit injustice by doing nothing" - [[Marcus Aurelius]]

"If you have to save someone that means that they've probably gone through something terrifying, they'll be frightened. Remember that real heroes don't just save lives, they save a person's heart too. You know what I think? No matter how scared you are, you should smile to show that things will be okay. In this world, the ones always smiling, are the ones who are the strongest. "

# Tarot Reading: What should I do regarding staying or leaving SCJ?
1. Hierophant
2. 9 Pentacles (r)
3. 5 wands (r)

This is a meaningful spread that offers deep insights into your dilemma about whether to stay at or leave your current job. Let's break down the interpretation of each card and how they relate to your situation.

## Reading 1:
### 1. The Hierophant

**Position:** Represents the current situation or underlying influences.

The Hierophant symbolizes tradition, structure, and adherence to established norms. In the context of your job, this card suggests that your current role is closely tied to conventional values or a structured environment. It may reflect a company with rigid protocols, a strong hierarchy, or a role that demands conformity. The Hierophant often speaks to the importance of following the rules and maintaining stability, indicating that your current job offers a sense of [[security]] and established order. However, it could also imply that this environment might feel restrictive or that there is a pressure to conform, which might be weighing on your decision.

### 2. Nine of Pentacles (Reversed)

**Position:** Represents challenges or obstacles.

The Nine of Pentacles in its reversed position suggests a feeling of being undervalued or not fully reaping the rewards of your hard work. You might be experiencing a sense of dissatisfaction or a lack of fulfillment in your current job, possibly due to financial concerns or a feeling that your contributions are not being recognized. This card can also point to issues of [[independence]]—perhaps you feel dependent on this job for [[security]], even if it’s not fully satisfying. There may be a fear of losing the stability and comfort that this job provides, which is creating internal conflict about whether to stay or go.

### 3. Five of Wands (Reversed)

**Position:** Represents advice or potential outcome.

The Five of Wands reversed indicates a desire to avoid conflict or the potential resolution of existing struggles. If there has been tension or competition at your job, this card suggests that you might be moving toward a period of greater harmony or that the situation could deescalate. In terms of advice, the reversed Five of Wands encourages you to consider paths that minimize unnecessary strife. It suggests that leaving the job might allow you to escape ongoing conflicts or stress, but it also warns against making a hasty decision out of a desire to avoid confrontation. Finding a peaceful resolution or compromise could be key.

### **Overall Interpretation:**

This spread suggests that your current job provides stability and structure (Hierophant), but you might feel unfulfilled or underappreciated (Nine of Pentacles reversed). The Five of Wands reversed encourages you to consider how you can resolve internal or external conflicts without rushing into a decision that might create more upheaval.

**Guidance:**

- Reflect on what stability and [[security]] mean to you and whether the structure of your current job aligns with your long-term goals.
- Assess whether the dissatisfaction you feel is something that can be addressed within your current role, or if it is a sign that it's time to move on.
- Seek to resolve any ongoing conflicts at work or within yourself before making a final decision. Sometimes, addressing these issues can bring clarity and lead to a more informed choice.

If you decide to stay, consider ways to improve your sense of value and fulfillment. If you decide to leave, ensure you’re not just avoiding [[discomfort]] but moving toward something that truly aligns with your aspirations.

## Reading 2:

In a three-card spread, each card typically represents a different aspect of the situation you're inquiring about. Let's break down the interpretation of your question about whether to stay or leave your current job:

1. **The Hierophant**: This card represents tradition, structure, and conformity. In the context of your job, it suggests that your current role is stable and aligns with established norms and expectations. The Hierophant may be urging you to consider the value of this stability and the benefits that come with being part of a structured environment. It could also indicate that there is something to learn or gain from staying, such as mentorship or deeper knowledge in your field. The card might be asking you to weigh the importance of tradition and the conventional path in your decision-making process.
    
2. **9 of Pentacles (Reversed)**: The Nine of Pentacles upright is about [[independence]], self-sufficiency, and enjoying the fruits of your labor. However, in its reversed position, it could suggest that you're feeling a lack of fulfillment or that you're not fully reaping the rewards of your hard work. This card might point to a sense of dissatisfaction or feeling undervalued in your current job. It could also indicate financial or material insecurity, which might be holding you back from making a change or fully enjoying your successes.
    
3. **5 of Wands (Reversed)**: The Five of Wands typically represents conflict, competition, or tension. In its reversed position, it suggests that the conflict may be subsiding or that you're looking to avoid confrontation and seek a more peaceful resolution. This card could indicate a desire to move away from a chaotic or competitive environment. It might also suggest that you're tired of the struggle and are seeking a more harmonious situation.
    

### Synthesis:

- The Hierophant suggests that staying in your current job offers stability, tradition, and perhaps important lessons or growth within a conventional structure.
- However, the reversed 9 of Pentacles indicates that you may be feeling unfulfilled, undervalued, or insecure, which is causing dissatisfaction.
- The reversed 5 of Wands suggests a desire to avoid further conflict or competition, seeking [[peace]] and resolution.

**Overall Interpretation**: The cards suggest a tension between the stability and traditional benefits your current job offers (Hierophant) and your feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for a more fulfilling and less contentious environment (9 of Pentacles reversed and 5 of Wands reversed). This spread leans towards the idea that while your current job is secure and offers a clear path, you may need to address the underlying dissatisfaction and desire for [[peace]]. It could be worth considering a change if you feel that your current situation is no longer serving your well-being, but the Hierophant suggests doing so with careful thought and respect for the traditional aspects that have value in your life.
