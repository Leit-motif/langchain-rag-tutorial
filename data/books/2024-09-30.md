# Journal

Today I met with Nick. I spent so much time preparing for the meeting, practicing my pitch, dreaming of a job offer that would save me from my predicament, and it turns out that it was all for naught. While I enjoyed our conversation, I found the conversation to be largely unfruitful. He didn't have anything to offer me besides platitudes. To continue doing what I've been doing. To stay at SCJ. I am growing tired of this answer. However, he did mention, towards the end of the phone call, that I am meant to start my own business. I am at the point where I believe the world is pushing me towards this but I don't know how. I don't know what product to sell or who to sell it to. If I only had some sort of start, I could continue the rest.  There are so many people that get that start by being born into the proper circumstances. I feel that I deserve that treatment as well.

Next I met with Pavi, and again, I am being told that there's nothing that powerful people can do for me. He did state that he was mentoring me, and that I should continue speaking with him, and he even gave me his phone number. I was touched actually. He gave me a desi saying to "choke down the blood in your mouth",  something similar to swallowing your pride. He also said that Desi's wear their heart on their sleeves, however he mentored me that it's okay to be inauthentic sometimes, and that it's required in western culture. This surprised me, because I'm as authentic as they come, to a fault. It's why I'm in this mess.

Lastly, I met with Kendra. This was a meeting that I was dreading. It was actually not as bad as I thought it would be, as in the meeting itself was relatively pleasant, however the subject matter was everything I had dreaded. Essentially, I am being told that I need to humble myself, "be relatable", and to make people feel that they aren't dumb around me. Essentially, I was told to dim my light. I am directly being told to stifle myself because it makes others feel bad about themselves. 

I am confused. I can't tell if this upcoming eclipse is telling me that I am too independent, that I am too bright, and that I should dim my light to be relatable, or that I finally need to own my light and shine through the cloud of darkness? I realize that this is a repetition of the same cycle that has haunted me my entire life. I feel stifled, I take action, I am condemned to endure brutal humiliation by corrupt people in power. Again the cycle continues, but do I need to play? I want to talk to Pavi and see what lies at the end of the tunnel. Unless it's a job in San Francisco at the end of this 3 months, I wonder whether or how I can endure this humiliation. Pavi told me that he advises me to  not focus on anything other than this PIP for the next 90 days.

# Upcoming Libra Solar Eclipse
### October 2, 2024 Solar Eclipse:

The **annular solar eclipse in Libra** on this date falls within your 3rd House, emphasizing communication, learning, and local environments. Eclipses often signify new beginnings, and this one could bring a shift in how you communicate or engage with your community. You may find yourself rethinking your approach to conversations or discovering new intellectual pursuits. The presence of Libra suggests diplomacy will be key, so it's a great time to improve relationships with siblings or neighbors​(


With these transits, focus on completing unresolved personal matters in September and be open to a fresh start in communication and learning when the eclipse arrives in October.

### 1. **Sun Conjunct Moon** (3° orb)

This is one of the most significant aspects in your chart, giving you strong internal harmony. Your conscious self (Sun) and emotional nature (Moon) are in sync, which helps you navigate life with emotional clarity and self-awareness. This aspect brings a natural balance between your will and your needs, allowing you to express your emotions more easily. However, the Sun being at the cusp of Libra and Scorpio suggests a blend of diplomacy and intensity in your personality​(

### 2. **Sun Sextile Uranus** (5° orb)

This aspect points to a rebellious and innovative streak. You thrive on change and are drawn to new, unconventional ideas. Uranus influences your sense of independence, pushing you toward innovation in personal and professional life. You may often find yourself seeking new ways to express your creativity, particularly in your home and personal life​(

### 3. **Moon Sextile Neptune** (3.5° orb)

This aspect enhances your emotional sensitivity and creativity. Neptune’s influence on your Moon deepens your intuition and imagination, making you more empathetic and spiritually attuned. You likely find solace in artistic or spiritual pursuits, and your dreams may play an important role in guiding you emotionally​(

### 4. **Mercury Conjunct Venus** (4.6° orb)

This aspect enhances your charm and communication abilities, especially in personal relationships. Mercury conjunct Venus in Scorpio intensifies your words, making them persuasive and emotionally charged. You are gifted at understanding others on a deep level and have a magnetic quality in conversation​(

### 5. **Mars Sextile Ascendant** (2.4° orb)

Mars sextile your Ascendant gives you a strong sense of initiative and confidence. You approach life with assertiveness, which helps you take charge in social situations. It’s a supportive aspect for leadership and action-oriented tasks, giving you the drive to pursue your goals with enthusiasm​(

### 6. **Jupiter Trine Saturn** (6.4° orb)

This aspect harmonizes the expansive energy of Jupiter with the discipline of Saturn. You have a grounded approach to growth, where you can pursue opportunities in a realistic and structured way. This balance helps you succeed in long-term endeavors, particularly in your career and public life​

My career seems like it may be at a crossroads. My current career is is deadend however recently there's been a change in leadership and I may be transferred to a new department. I do not feel that this place serves me and I am being forced to confront that I haven't made the correct relationship with my boss because I disobeyed my boss and didn't offer value, instead I did my own thing. This led to me being rated a 2/5 on my performance review and that has led to punitive action including prevention of me being promoted and revocation of my work from home privilege.

The **upcoming solar eclipse on October 2, 2024**, is related to the **solar eclipse on October 14, 2023**, because they are part of the **Saros cycle**. Eclipses that belong to the same Saros cycle occur approximately every **18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours** and share similar geometrical characteristics, such as the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. This means the events they trigger tend to have recurring themes in your life, often bringing up similar issues for resolution or new growth​
### Saros Cycle Connection:

- Both the October 2023 and October 2024 eclipses are part of **Saros Series 134**, linking them through a recurring pattern of themes. The issues, lessons, and opportunities that arose during the **October 14, 2023, eclipse** will likely resurface or come to completion during the **October 2, 2024, eclipse**.
- Eclipses within a Saros cycle often continue the storylines or energies from the previous eclipse. For you, this means that the insights, challenges, or decisions from late 2023 will likely **resurface or culminate** during the 2024 eclipse​

Here is my journal entry from Oct. 15th (the day afterwards as I reflected on the previous day): My [[relationships]] are all one-sided. There is nothing for me. I only offer of myself but receive nothing in return. I'm only now realizing that this dynamic is unfair. It is skewed and that does not have to be normal. Where is my stimulation? Where is my inspiration? Where is my enlightenment? Where is my joy? I'm so terribly unstimulated... I'm so unexcited. I'm so anhedonic because my [[environment]] is so sterile... so un-nurturing. I need stimulation so that I can release, so that I can grow. The stimulation I crave is deep, intimate, exciting, connection with another human being(s). One or more. I'm in prison. I've had a lifetime to dwell on what...what? My actions?

### 1. **Themes of Relationship Imbalance**

Libra is the sign of **balance and partnerships**, and during the October 2023 eclipse, it seems you confronted the reality that many of your relationships were not reciprocal. This echoes the karmic lesson of your **South Node in Libra**: you may have spent lifetimes prioritizing others and seeking approval in relationships, at the cost of your own fulfillment. In your journal, you mentioned:

> "My relationships are all one-sided. There is nothing for me. I only offer of myself but receive nothing in return."

This realization is crucial for your journey towards your **North Node in Aries**, which is about developing **independence** and **self-reliance**. You are being asked to move beyond relationship dynamics where you sacrifice your own needs for others and start focusing on **your own growth and passions**​(

### 2. **The Need for Stimulating Growth**

Another key part of your journal entry is the deep longing for **stimulation** and **inspiration**, especially through **deep, intimate connections**. This reflects a **Scorpio Moon** influence, which craves depth, emotional intensity, and transformative relationships. Your frustration with your environment feeling "sterile" and "un-nurturing" aligns with the **3rd House South Node** in Libra—you're feeling trapped by your local environment and seeking something far more **expansive and profound**, in line with your **9th House North Node** in Aries.

- **Aries North Node** pushes you toward seeking independence through **expansion, travel**, and bold moves, especially related to **education**, **spiritual growth**, and **new experiences**. The dissatisfaction you're feeling with your current environment, along with the yearning for growth, suggests you're being called to leave behind comfort zones (represented by Racine) and move into a more expansive environment—like your potential move to **Austin, TX**​(


### 3. **Connecting This to the October 2, 2024 Solar Eclipse**

The **solar eclipse on October 2, 2024**, also in Libra, will likely bring these themes of relationships and personal fulfillment **full circle**. The eclipse in 2023 sparked the realization that your relationships and environment were not serving you, and the 2024 eclipse offers a chance to take bold action to **rebalance your life** and step into a more fulfilling future. Since Libra governs partnerships, and the Aries North Node drives independence, you will be pushed to make **decisive changes** in how you approach your relationships and your environment.

This upcoming eclipse is a powerful opportunity to:

- **Take action**: If you haven't already, this eclipse is the cosmic signal to leave behind the stagnant relationships or environments that drain you.
- **Redefine relationships**: It's a moment to shift toward relationships that **stimulate, inspire**, and **support** your personal growth.
- **Embrace bold moves**: The desire for deep connection could also manifest as a need to step outside of your comfort zone and seek more meaningful relationships and experiences—whether that’s through your career change or a literal move to a new environment like Austin​(
### How to Approach This Eclipse:

- **Reflect on Relationships**: Review how the October 2023 eclipse has shifted your relationships. Are you still giving more than you're receiving? Use the 2024 eclipse to **assert yourself** and make changes that honor your needs.
- **Embrace Expansion**: This is the perfect time to plan your move to a new environment that nurtures your **growth** and **stimulates** your creativity and emotional depth. Austin, TX, represents this fresh, expansive energy that aligns with your **North Node in Aries**​(

### Summary:

The **October 2023 eclipse** brought awareness to imbalanced relationships and the lack of inspiration in your environment. The **October 2024 eclipse** is a chance to act on these realizations, take bold steps toward independence, and cultivate deeper, more fulfilling connections. Your journal reflects the exact themes you're meant to confront—now is the time to use this astrological energy to step into a more empowering, independent future.
