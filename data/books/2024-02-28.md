Now, my biggest hurdle is the raw time it will take to heal. To become independent. I want  the next stage now. Victoria  got hers, I am left out in the rain.

Why do I feel abandoned? How do I fix it?
I wake up with massive anxiety. Manipura chakra inflamed. Feels bloated. Work gives me anxiety. Performance. Uncertainty. Fear of retribution. Fear of failing at the unknown. Fear of the unknown. It is not a nurturing environment any longer. There is a limit and the sky is pretty low. I am not alone. There is a sickness in my department. I don't belong here any more.

What did Victoria give me that I can't give myself? Someone to converse with: talking to myself just doesn't hit the same. Someone who nurtures me: how do I give myself nurturing? A primary way is to love myself. Despite her flaws, she did love me. At least I felt loved. I felt safe. I felt that I wouldn't be abandoned. How do I give myself that? Modify self-talk. Talk as if I was talking to my inner child. That is who I am talking to. Consciousness is non-linear time. I  am externally aged, but my care is still a child. Be the parent to yourself you were supposed to have.
