# Daily Law
## Create a Cultlike Following

Having a large following opens up all sorts of possibilities for [[deception]]; not only will your followers worship you, they will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of [[Power]] will lift you to another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to enforce your will. You are adored and can do no wrong. You might think it’s a gargantuan task to create such a following, but in fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have a desperate need to believe in something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot endure long periods of [[Doubt]], or the emptiness that comes from a lack of something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get-rich-quick scheme, or the latest technological trend or art movement, and we leap as one from the water to take the bait.

> Daily Law: People have an overwhelming desire to [[believe]] in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. In the absence of organized [[religion]] and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold [[power]].

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Express gratitude for the [[beauty]] of the natural world.

I am thankful for living across from a park as well as around so many trees. When I go for a walk, I am able to believe that I am walking in a relatively green area, not a concrete jungle. I am thankful for the natural [[beauty]] I have experienced so far. I know in time, I may even come to appreciate the farm land that has surrounded me my entire life. I disdain it now, but there is a charm to it.

# [[Homo Deus]]
## We have transcended war, famine, and plague as a species. 

[[War]] isn’t profitable, more people die from obesity than they do starvation, and we have eradicated entire diseases from the planet, with any new epidemic, it’s not a matter of if there’s a cure, it’s a matter of when. 

## We are working on transcending mortality

Amortality through life extension rather than immortality. It will affect our capacity to take risks. It will cause social upheaval. Only for the wealthy, an exploitable market. 

### Amortality vs Immortality
**Immortality** and **amortality** are two different concepts:

- [**Immortality** refers to the state of being able to live forever or having an endless existence](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality)[1](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality). [This concept is often associated with divine or supernatural beings who are believed to be exempt from [[death]]](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality)[1](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality). [In modern times, the concept of immortality has been explored in science fiction and futurist literature, with some proposing that humans may one day achieve immortality through technological advancements such as mind uploading or genetic engineering](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality)[1](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality).
    
- **Amortality**, on the other hand, is a term that is not as commonly used as immortality. [It does not have a standard definition in dictionaries like Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mortality)[2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mortality)[, Cambridge](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality)[3](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mortality)[, Dictionary.com](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality)[4](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mortality)[, or Britannica](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/immortality-vs-mortality)[5](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/mortality). However, in some contexts, it has been used to describe a state in which aging is not a factor and [[death]] is not inevitable, but can occur due to disease or injury. This is different from immortality where [[death]] is not possible.
## We have a right to [[happiness]] itself. 

The [[Epicurist]] ideal, that there is no afterlife and that the only thing that matters is today’s [[happiness]], is the defacto norm today. Epicurists state that attaining the ultimate pleasure is hard work. Temperance leads to the greatest [[happiness]].

[[Happiness]] a better indicator of progress than GDP.

Suicide higher in developed countries. 

[[Happiness]] relies on [[expectations]], not objective conditions. [[Happiness]] when [[environment]] meets our expectations.

[[Happiness]] relies on bodily sensations. Biological component. We never react to events in the [[external world]]. only to bodily sensations within us, representations of the objective world.

[[Emotions]] are bodily sensations. These are biochemical signals that evolution has built into us to reward reproduction and continuation of the species.

These sensations are [[transitory]]. Will never be enough. They disappear as fast as they arise. 

Even when we are able to experience pleasant sensations, we don't even react with contentment, we react with craving for more.

Healing vs upgrading is a gradient transition of the application of technology.

Studying history loosens the grip held on us by the past.
# Novel
## early era first beings of mind and matter 
play on cybernetic enhancement and [[transhumanism]] control by having early souls build up their bodies as modular pieces of consciousness taken from various gods. The [[purpose]] of evolution in matter at this time is to develop more modules increasingly interesting modules so experimentation and living are prioritized.

First the descent of Spirit into mind, then the descent of mind into matter.

## Gods can be in many places at once by having multiple incarnations or bodies.
