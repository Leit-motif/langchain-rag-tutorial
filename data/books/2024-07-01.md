# Energy Audit

6am - it felt harder to wake up because I lost 1 hour of sleep waking up in the middle of the night.

4pm - after work, I felt tired af. I felt drained and the only thing that I wanted to do was play music and watch anime. 

7pm - finding some extra energy.

# [[AI]]

- understanding [[statistics]] and deep learning is more important than TensorFlow vs PyTorch.  
- understanding functional and object-oriented programming is more important than [[Python]] or R.  
- understanding feature engineering is more important than Scikit-learn vs XGBoost.  
- understanding scalable and resilient architectures is more important than GCP or AWS.  
- understanding models serving is more important than FastAPI or Streamlit.

Knowing these will allow you to pick up new emerging tools easily.  
  
Stick to fundamentals first.

A strong foundation in [[statistics]], programming, feature engineering, scalable architecture, and model deployment will always be invaluable.
