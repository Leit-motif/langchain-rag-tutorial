# Pavi
Today I spoke with Pavi and the meeting didn't pan out how I thought it would. I thought I was going to sell myself however it seems like he already knew everything about me. Apparently there's been a lot of talk. It's like I wanted to speak of technical progress but Pavi only wanted to discuss interpersonal stuff. He left me with the mission to reach out to Kendra in an informal setting and ask how I can improve. He wants to see if I'll bend, if I can show humility. I can pass this test. 

However, I'm at a loss. I am being told to be less of myself. This doesn't sound right in absolute terms, however it does feel practical. His advice was to tone myself down, to practice [[temperance]]. [[Temperance]] is a stoic [[virtue]], and I am a [[Libra]] Sun. I know that this is a test, and honestly, regardless of the message, this is a person that said he would take care of me and protect me, in so many words. I haven't had a person on my side in so long, I've forgotten what it feels like.
