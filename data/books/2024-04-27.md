# Daily Law
## Despise the Free Lunch

The powerful never forget that *what is offered for free is inevitably a trick*. Friends who offer favors without asking for payment will later want something far dearer than the money you would have paid them. The bargain has hidden problems, both material and psychological. What has worth is worth paying for. *By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, [[guilt]], and deceit*. It is also often wise to pay the full price—there is no cutting corners with excellence.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Share something you’re thankful for about your ability to adapt to change.

I am thankful for how I have handled my true breakup with [[Victoria]]. It has been a relatively short amount of time, and while I am not in my next stage of life, I am in the greatest training arc of my life so far! The universe is change and I am learning to let go. 

# [[Disassociation]]
[[[Success]] is an Ephemeral Pipedream for 99.9% - Gnaw Your Arm Off To Escape The Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFoZyZzClwg&t=1s)

Lofty goals is just dissociating into the future. You know you won't pursue them in the presence.

# [[Approval]]/[[Validation]]

I'm trying to get people to re-parent me, I didn't have [[self]] [[love]], I'm trying to get [[love]] from someone else.

# [Getting what you want](https://youtu.be/Jfay75tkIPk)
[[Owen Cook]]

[[Validation]] is like a drug high, temporary proxy for persistent (immortal) fulfillment. It is a dirty high. 

[[Self]]-audit what you want out of life. This will enable you to erect boundaries. Make goals realistic as well as ambitious. Every next step needs to be doable

Time audit, daily schedule. Establish window of time when you'll be in your prime. How do be ready for your prime window. 

What else?
Opportunity cost.

I want to be like [[Leonardo da Vinci]] but I believe he was just born that way, there's nothing I can learn to become that way. Depressing. 

Going to new places allows one to redefine themselves, to rewrite their story. It is very hard to write over a story that's already been written. There's no room on the page, the writing is illegible.

[[Scarcity]] vs [[Abundance]]
You don’t need to live in [[scarcity]] any more. [[Scarcity]] is a choice. Constraints are useful however there is a balance between [[constraint]] and [[inertia]].

# [[Are We Enslaved to One Side of the Brain- – The Sickness of Modern Man]]
[[Experiential Self]], [[narrating self]]

The right sees the world as it is, however it is too complex to comprehend, to contain, therefore it requires a diffused [[focus]], [[Attention]], it cannot manipulate due to the lack of brightness of the diffusion. 

Thus the left brain must cut, reduce, create a proxy of reality, a predictive model that it constructs as a proxy for reality with which it can manipulate reality. This simplification, this caricature of the world ends up being preferable to the complexity,  [[chaos]], and unapproachability of the real world. Of the world, we create a means to an end rather than accepting the world as an end to itself.



# [[Second Brain]] folder [[structure]] based on parts of speech, grammatical categories, word classes, lexical categories.
I am creating a folder [[structure]] for my [[second brain]]. I have a "Concepts" folder and a "Skills" folder. Can I relate these to the grammatical concepts of Nouns and Verbs?

Absolutely, that’s a creative way to think about it! In grammar, **nouns** are often the things, people, or places that are the subject of discussion, while **verbs** are the actions or states of being.

In your [[second brain]]:

- The **“Concepts”** folder could be seen as your “nouns”. These are the overarching themes, ideas, or subjects that you’re exploring. They are the ‘things’ in your [[second brain]].
- The **“Skills”** folder could be seen as your “verbs”. These are the actions, techniques, or abilities that you’re learning or improving upon. They represent ‘doing’ or ‘action’ in your [[second brain]].

This analogy can help you quickly understand and navigate your notes. Just remember, the most important thing is that your system makes sense to you and supports your learning and thinking process.

Continue this chain of thought. What are other folders for all of the other grammatical entities?

That’s a great thought exercise! Here’s how you might extend the analogy:

1. **Adjectives/Adverbs Folder (“Qualities”)**: Adjectives and adverbs describe or modify nouns and verbs. In your [[second brain]], this could be a folder for qualities or characteristics that you’re interested in or that recur in your notes. This could include things like “[[resilience]]”, “efficiency”, “creativity”, etc.
    
2. **Prepositions Folder (“Contexts”)**: Prepositions often indicate location, direction, time, or manner. This could translate to a folder for different contexts or environments in your life or work, such as “home”, “work”, “health”, etc.
    
3. **Conjunctions Folder (“Connections”)**: Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses. This could be a folder for exploring and documenting the connections or [[relationships]] between different concepts, skills, or contexts.
    
4. **Interjections Folder (“Reflections”)**: Interjections express strong [[emotion]] or sudden exclamations. This could be a folder for personal reflections, insights, or “aha!” moments that you want to capture.
    
5. **Pronouns Folder (“Roles”)**: Pronouns stand in for nouns in sentences. This could be a folder for different roles or identities that you hold, such as “student”, “teacher”, “parent”, etc.

[[Futility]]
So our ideals are doomed, never to be realized…Was the world I envisioned so fragile, that such a small-minded belief can crush it underfoot?

# [[[Obsidian]] vs Notion: Which is BETTER?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX8Z-BN9Ae8)

## [[Architect vs Gardener]] frame
### [[Architect]]
[[A priori knowledge]] - independent of experience.
Structured
Know the [[structure]] in advance.
Methodical, planned, orderly
Design everything upfront before implementation.
Waterfall
Top-down
Leaves little room for deviation
Controlled

### [[Gardener]]
[[A posteriori knowledge]] - dependent on [[empirical evidence]] or [[experience]]
Unstructured
Agile
Chaotic
Best for building mental models
metaphor: 
- plant seeds, water them, provide sunlight, prune
- They foster/manipulate the [[environment]] but do not actually control it, nor do they control the plants themselves. 
- They react to the needs of the plants and [[environment]]
- The final outcome is not entirely predictable but emerges from the interaction between the gardener and plants
bottom-up
organic
adaptive, flexible

# [[Fear and Anxiety, Explained]]
Go to the gym, work on the external.
Realize you are missing the internal.
Build the internal.
Let it all go because even after working on all of that, you don’t actually have any control in this world.
