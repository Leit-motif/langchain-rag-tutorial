# [[Victoria]]

I talked to Ori and I was able to do a post-mortem. It was nice connecting with her after so long. We were able to talk about our relationship a bit. I cried when she told me that even though we didnâ€™t always like each other, we still loved each other. 

I felt a weight lifted. I feel like I can move on now.
