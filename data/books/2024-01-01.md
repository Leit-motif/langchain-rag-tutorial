# Daily Law
## Seem Dumber Than Your Mark

> Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man plays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest [[wisdom]] consists in appearing not to know—you must not be ignorant but capable of playing it.
> 
> —[[Baltasar Gracián]]

If you are ambitious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy, this trick can be useful: Appearing less intelligent than you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even promote you since you seem so likable and subservient. Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there? Taste and sophistication rank close to intelligence on the vanity scale; make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard will come down. An air of complete [[Naivete]] can work wonders.

> Daily Law: In general, always make people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They will keep you around because you make them feel better about themselves, and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to deceive them.
