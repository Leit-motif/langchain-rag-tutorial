# Journal

"Maturity includes the recognition that no one is going to see anything in us that we don't see in ourselves."

We learn about ourselves in relationship to others. Each relationship organically pulls certain parts of us to into the foreground while others recede into the background.

The more needless you are, the more you can indulge in mature [[love]], not transactional [[love]].

Rock-bottom isn't absolute, it's when you stop digging.

All of our gods have clay feet.

# The meaning of life
For it to be fair, the meaning of life needs to be accessible to everyone.  That means at every place and every time. That means that the meaning life is accessible at any moment in time, by anyone. It can't be found in a particular place/time. It's something you come into greater awareness and experience with. 

# [[Vinland Saga]]


# Make a list of wrong assumptions I have about life
### 1. **Work and Survival Are Indivisible**

- Belief: A job directly equals survival and [[security]], and without it, there’s no safety net.
- Reality: You have significant savings, a year of financial buffer, and skills that could help you freelance, consult, or explore alternative work [[models]]. Survival can be managed differently.

### 2. **Quitting Equals Failure**

- Belief: Quitting your job will make you like your [[father]] or confirm others’ negative judgments about you.
- Reality: Quitting could be an empowered choice that aligns with your long-term goals and [[values]]. Staying in a toxic role may harm you more than leaving.

### 3. **Relocation Is the Only Path Forward**

- Belief: Moving to a tech hub is necessary to escape stagnation or find a fulfilling [[career]].
- Reality: Remote work opportunities are growing. Building a network or brand online may offer the same access and [[freedom]] without relocation.

### 4. **Others' Judgments Are Unavoidable Truths**

- Belief: The judgments from family or colleagues are accurate reflections of your worth or potential.
- Reality: These judgments may stem from their own limitations, fears, or cultural expectations, not from objective truths.

### 5. **Emotional Distance Requires Physical Distance**

- Belief: To create emotional boundaries with family, you must move away.
- Reality: Emotional distance can be cultivated through mindset shifts, communication, and [[self]]-prioritization, even without physical distance.

### 6. **Success Requires Immediate Progress**

- Belief: If you’re not making visible progress every day, you are failing.
- Reality: [[Growth]] isn’t always linear, and there are phases where rest, reflection, or waiting is necessary for real progress to occur later.

### 7. **Entrepreneurship Must Provide Immediate Freedom**

- Belief: Starting a business will immediately grant you [[freedom]] and [[security]].
- Reality: [[Entrepreneurship]] often brings challenges and hard work before [[freedom]] and stability come. Progress is gradual, requiring patience and [[resilience]].

### 8. **AI Roles Are Currently Out of Reach**

- Belief: Your lack of direct [[AI]] experience disqualifies you from [[AI]]-related roles.
- Reality: Your skills in data management, project leadership, and problem-solving are highly transferable. Targeted certifications or small [[AI]] projects could open doors sooner than expected.

### 9. **You Must Do It All Alone**

- Belief: Because of isolation and past betrayals, you need to solve everything on your own.
- Reality: There are potential allies, mentors, or online communities that could help, even if you haven’t met them yet. Support exists beyond your immediate surroundings.

### 10. **Your Father's Legacy Defines Your Fate**

- Belief: You are destined to repeat your [[father]]’s story if you misstep.
- Reality: Your awareness, [[determination]], and actions demonstrate that you’re already on a different path. Your future is your own to shape.

### 11. **Your Identity Is Tied to Your Job Title**

- Belief: Your job role determines your sense of [[self]] and social worth.
- Reality: [[Identity]] is multi-faceted. Your creativity, intelligence, [[values]], and [[relationships]] define you more than any title.

### 12. **Enduring Toxicity Will Lead to a Reward**

- Belief: If you endure the toxic work [[environment]], a better opportunity will eventually emerge.
- Reality: Staying in an unhealthy [[environment]] may drain your [[energy]] and delay meaningful change. Sometimes, walking away is the reward.

### 13. **Control Equals Power**

- Belief: To succeed, you must control your [[environment]] and the people in it.
- Reality: True [[power]] often lies in adaptability, letting go of things beyond your control, and focusing [[energy]] where you have influence.

### 14. **Progress Requires Hard Struggle**

- Belief: Without struggle and suffering, progress is not legitimate.
- Reality: [[Growth]] can also happen through joy, [[flow]], and meaningful exploration, not only through hardship.
