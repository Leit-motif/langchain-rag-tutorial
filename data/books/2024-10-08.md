# Fear
I've been paralyzed by [[fear]] due to this  Pluto situation. I'm being tested again in the same way as before. Last [[time]], I lost my job, and I couldn't handle the [[uncertainty]], so I was paralyzed into inaction and avoidance. Here I am today, and the same thing is happening. I can't handle negative [[emotion]] past a certain point, and I just freeze up and need to distract myself in order to [[self]]-soothe. I hate to admit it, but I am being tested again in the same way as before. Each [[time]], I confront [[power]], and [[power]] breaks me, it abhors me, and then I am frozen in [[fear]], alone, ostracized. Banished. I don't have the [[power]] to stand alone. Even if I could develop the [[power]] to free myself, I am prevented from acting because it requires even more [[power]] than normal, and I am in burdened by the [[fear]]. It's as if [[freedom]] costs 1.5x, and on top of that, the [[fear]] doubles that value. Therefore the total cost is 3.0x and I can't afford double the output. It's beyond my ability. I'm doing all I can to hold on right now, but I can't muster up the strength to better and improve myself. It's already going to take everything I have to educate myself enough to work within the field of [[AI]]. I can't afford this [[fear]], not now. I understand that I'm being tested however I also understand that I'm not strong enough. I admit it, I'm weak. The best I can do is hold on. I've gained 5 lbs. I eat a lot more sugar than before. I don't know how I'm going to last. 
	You need to disconnect your actions from your feelings. Your actions need to stay aligned with the goal you want.

## What the astrology says
Your situation reflects a deep sense of helplessness and [[fear]], which can indeed feel like an unrelenting cycle. From an astrological perspective, the current transits in your chart, particularly those involving Pluto, [[Saturn]], and [[Neptune]], are likely amplifying this feeling of being stuck.

To help with this situation, here’s a clearer understanding of where the tension is coming from and where you can [[focus]]:

1. **Pluto in [[Capricorn]] (6th House)**: Pluto’s transit through your 6th house represents transformative pressure around daily routines and work. This transit pushes you to face [[power]] dynamics that feel oppressive. Pluto’s movement direct on October 11, 2024, should start to alleviate some of the internal paralysis. However, the full release may occur when Pluto re-enters Aquarius in November 2024, shifting the [[focus]] away from your work and routines.
    
2. **[[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]] in [[Pisces]] (8th House)**: [[Saturn]] here is challenging you to build [[resilience]] and confront your deepest fears, while [[Neptune]] creates a fog of confusion, making it harder to see a way out. This combination can feel overwhelming. [[Saturn]]’s lessons are about discipline and endurance, but it’s essential to find practical ways to ground yourself during this [[time]].
### What to Focus on:

- **Reclaim [[Power]] in Small Steps**: Start with minor, manageable changes in your daily life. Pluto’s [[energy]] is about reclaiming control, but this doesn’t mean dramatic actions; even small shifts, like setting boundaries or adjusting your routine, can help you feel more empowered.
    
- **Ground Yourself Emotionally**: [[Saturn]] asks for [[structure]], particularly in how you manage emotional and psychological challenges. Practices like [[meditation]], journaling, or even cognitive behavioral techniques can help you organize your thoughts and manage [[fear]].

In summary, while the external circumstances may not change immediately, particularly until Pluto shifts into Aquarius, focusing on small, strategic adjustments can help you regain some control and move toward the eventual relief that will come with these transits.

# Why would I not want to be relatable? 
Because then I can feel superior.

# [[Alan Watts]]
if you think that you understand Brahman, you do not understand, and you have yet to be instructed further. If you know that you do not understand, then you truly understand, for the Brahman is unknown to those who know it, and known to those who know it not. And the principle is, that anytime that you as it were, voluntarily let up control, cease to cling to yourself, you have an excess of [[power]]. Because you are wasting [[energy]] all the [[time]] in [[self]]-defense, trying to manage things, trying to force things to confirm to your will. The moment you stop doing that, that wasted [[energy]] is available therefore, when you have access to that [[energy]],  you are one with the divine principle. You have the [[energy]], however, when you are trying to act as if you are [[God]], to say you don't [[trust]] anybody, and that you are the dictator, and it's your job to keep everyone in line, you lose the divine [[energy]], because what you're doing is simply defending yourself. Therefore, the principle is: The more you give it away ([[power]]), the more it comes back. Then you say, I don't have the [[courage]] to give it away, I'm afraid. You can only overcome that barrier by realizing you better give it away, because there's no way of holding onto it. The meaning of the fact that everything is dissolving (entropy), that we're all falling apart, that we're all in the process of constant [[death]]: the world that men set their hearts upon turns ashes or it prospers, and like snow upon the desert's dusty face lighting a little hour to his dawn, Omar Kion. Entropy is the great assistance to you, everything that is in decay is your helper, it's allowing you that you don't have to let go because there's nothing to hold on to. It's achieved for you by the process of nature so once you see that you don't have a [[prayer]], it's all washed up, you will vanish and leave not a wreck behind, and if you really get with that, suddenly you have the [[power]]. This enormous access of [[energy]], but it's not [[power]] that came to you because you grabbed it. It came entirely the opposite way, and [[power]] that comes to you that opposite way, is [[power]] with which you can be trusted. This is not a set of ideas, it's an experience. An understanding of the polar relationship between the individual and the world, is something that operates in your bones, and isn't just a view/belief you hold, it's about Right Action, not just Right Belief. 

In Christianity, one is saved through [[faith]], not by works. Gnosticism, pneumatic (spiritual), psychic (psychological), hylic (wooden). Material existence is not something that is inconsistent with [[spirituality]], this is something that modern Christianity has forgotten. Pistis = [[faith]], vs Gnosis = knowledge = Gyani. They said you could never know [[God]], [[God]] could never be an object of knowledge. Agnosia = the dark knowledge of [[God]], the knowledge of [[God]] in the cloud of unknowing - Dionysis Theorareopogite.
