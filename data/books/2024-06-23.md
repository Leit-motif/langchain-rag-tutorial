# Daily Law
## play to Their High [[Self]]-Opinion

> The true spirit of conversation consists more in bringing out the cleverness of others than in showing a great deal of it yourself.
> 
> —Jean de La Bruyère

If you need a favor from people, do not remind them of what you have done for them in the past, trying to stimulate feelings of gratitude. Gratitude is rare because it tends to remind us of our helplessness, our dependence on others. We like to feel independent. Instead, remind them of the good things they have done for you in the past. This will help confirm their [[self]]-opinion: “Yes, I am generous.” And once reminded, they will want to continue to live up to this image and do yet another good deed. A similar effect can come from suddenly forgiving your enemies and forging a rapprochement. In the emotional turmoil this creates, they will feel obligated to live up to the high opinion you have now shown toward them and will be extra motivated to prove themselves worthy.

- **Practical Steps:** Allocate your time to tasks that generate value, ensuring each minute contributes to your overall goals.

<H2>Annual [[Time Management]]</H2>

- **The 4,000 Hour Year:** Instead of viewing a year as a calendar year, break it down into 4,000 productive hours.
- **Goal-Oriented Time Allocation:** Allocate time based on your annual goals and leverage your team to achieve [[success]].
- **Managing Control:** As an entrepreneur, [[focus]] on how you use your time, as it is one of the few things you can control.

<H2>Mindset Shift: From Skills to Solutions</H2>

- **Solving Problems:** Entrepreneurs should [[focus]] on solving problems rather than just developing skills.
- **Identifying Market Gaps:** Spend your time identifying problems and gaps in your market, and build a team to address these issues.
