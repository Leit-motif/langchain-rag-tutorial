# Daily Law
## Sow the Seeds of [[Doubt]]

> It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation.
> 
> —[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]

**[[Doubt]] is a powerful weapon**: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand, they can deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so desperately? Maybe the rumor has some [[truth]] to it? If, on the other hand, they take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. If done correctly, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your rivals that in defending themselves they will make numerous mistakes. **This is the perfect weapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work from**.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Express gratitude for the ability to travel and experience new things.

I am grateful that I have a car and that I can just hop in and drive to the Chicago area for culture, including the experiences of Exxxotica and Fogo de Chao. Driving also enabled me to drive to Indiana to see the solar eclipse totality. 

**I want to travel more frequently and experience new things!** I have a lifetime to make up for. 

# We are a [[family]] and this is our [[home]].
[[Parts theory]]
The [[inner parent]], the [[narrating self]] and the [[inner child]], the [[experiential self]] form the core. 

The parts are the siblings of the [[inner child]]. 

This physical body and the mind that is anchored to it is their [[home]].
