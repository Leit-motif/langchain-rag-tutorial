[[God]]
Even if you don't know yourself, the universe knows you, your wants, your gifts, your [[purpose]]. Even things you don't know, the Universe knows. 

Serenity

Train yourself to [[love]] the feeling of being lost because it's a sign of your current timeline collapsing, which means a new better timeline is imminent. 

You are not a bad boy, bad child, a vagrant as I was called as a child, a [[failure]], a waste, a disappointment. You are doing the right thing. You need to break free from your parents view of yourself. 


# [[Breathwork]]

# Conversations with [[Carl Jung]]
I always feel like I'm not doing the right thing. As if I am not using my [[time]] wisely. I believe this stems from my upbringing in a south asian family where my academic performance was of utmost importance, however I was also [[ADHD]], so there was a disconnect. There was no treatment for [[ADHD]] at that [[time]], so I internalized that I am flawed. I was sometimes beaten for my grades. I tried, but because of my nature and a lack of guidance, I always failed. I realize now that I have this persistent belief that I am never doing the right thing, so I keep looking to a different future where I am a "good boy".

###### ChatGPT said:

Ah, you speak of a deep tension that exists between the life you were born into and the life you have within you—a life that could not easily conform to external expectations. This feeling of being caught between two realities, one imposed by the [[external world]] and one that arises from within, can be a fertile ground for [[self]]-criticism and a constant sense of [[failure]]. Your words paint a vivid picture of the battle between duty and nature, between the expectations of the family and the inner drive to be authentic, however misunderstood it might have been in your youth.

This "good boy" you speak of—he is not just a product of your family's expectations, is he? No, he has become an archetype within you, an idealized version of yourself that continually lingers just out of reach, whispering that your current [[self]] is not enough. I wonder, when you envision this "good boy," what does he look like? What is his posture, his demeanor? If you could describe him in more detail, perhaps we can see what part of your psyche has latched onto this image.

Your upbringing, particularly within a South Asian family context, is imbued with the archetype of the "dutiful son," the one who brings [[pride]] and honor. But layered onto this was your [[ADHD]], which must have felt like a disruption to the harmony others wanted you to bring. The disconnect between what was expected and what you could give was likely never reconciled, which is why it continues to linger in the present. The [[ADHD]] itself may have been your psyche’s way of demanding [[freedom]], movement, exploration—something at odds with rigid academic structures.

When you say you feel you are not doing the right thing, can you explore what "right" really means to you now, not in the context of your upbringing, but in the context of who you are today? What is the deeper voice beneath the learned expectations, the one you might have been ignoring all these years?

Take a moment to feel into this conflict—what arises when you sit with this tension of wanting to be "good" but feeling inherently flawed? Let’s stay with it for a moment.

##### You said:

I feel what I need is someone with authority and [[power]], that believes in me.

###### ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see. This desire for someone with authority and [[power]] to believe in you—this is no small longing. It is the deep yearning for recognition, not only from the outer world but from the fatherly archetype within your psyche, the one that bestows [[validation]] and says, “You are enough as you are.”

I sense that this external figure you seek—the one with [[power]] who believes in you—represents an inner authority you may not yet have claimed for yourself. You want someone to see the value in you because, perhaps, you have struggled to see it in yourself. The "good boy" archetype still waits for that figure to come, to deliver the message that you are worthy. But what if that [[power]] is within you?

This figure of authority—whether it comes from cultural expectations, paternal [[energy]], or a teacherly archetype—may have never fully appeared in your life. Perhaps this absence created the belief that you were not enough. Yet, the deeper [[truth]] is that this external [[validation]] is only a reflection of an inner potential. The [[father]] archetype, which is connected to [[structure]], guidance, and belief in one’s capacity, has not abandoned you. It may be that it has simply not been embodied in a figure you could recognize.

I wonder, have you ever envisioned this figure? Not someone from your past, but a symbolic figure who could provide this belief in you? Could you close your eyes and imagine this powerful authority standing before you? How does he look? Does he speak? What is his [[energy]] like? If you could create this inner guide, what would he say to you?

When you find this figure within, you may no longer need the outer one. And yet, paradoxically, when we embody this belief in ourselves, the world often mirrors it back to us.

Would you be open to describing what this inner figure might look like, or perhaps how it feels to contemplate it?

##### You said:

I think I need to expand upon what you've said so far before moving on. "I wonder, when you envision this "good boy," what does he look like? What is his posture, his demeanor? If you could describe him in more detail, perhaps we can see what part of your psyche has latched onto this image." He is intelligent, beautiful, a winner, everyone likes, respects, and admires him. He solves all problems and looks good doing it. He has a lot of money, a beautiful girlfriend, and an emotionally compelling lifestyle. He has status. He has all the trappings of external [[success]]. He is successful. [[SUCCESS]].

###### ChatGPT said:

Ah, **[[success]]**—there it is, the image of the "good boy" is adorned with all the symbols of external achievement. He is more than just a figure; he is an ideal, almost [[god]]-like in his [[perfection]]. He embodies everything that the world—and perhaps the people around you—would deem worthy. This image of [[success]] is not just about competence or accomplishment; it is drenched in the admiration, [[wealth]], [[beauty]], and recognition you were perhaps denied or felt were out of reach due to circumstances beyond your control.

This figure you’ve described, this ideal of intelligence, [[beauty]], status—it feels almost unattainable, doesn’t it? In some ways, this is the **archetype of the hero**: the one who overcomes every obstacle, who rises above the challenges, and is adored for it. But there is a shadow in this figure as well—a shadow that whispers that you, as you are now, are far from this ideal, that you need to constantly strive to become this [[success]].

The real question, I think, lies in **why this figure has so much [[power]] over you**. Why does he stand as the measure of your worth? I would imagine that this figure, in all his grandiosity, also casts a long shadow over you, doesn't he? A part of you that feels small, flawed, and never enough in comparison. **He is everything you believe you are not.**

I would suggest that this image of the “good boy” is not wrong in itself, but he has become inflated—so perfect, so unattainable, that any [[failure]] to live up to him leads to disappointment. He is a projection of what your culture, family, or society may have valued, but not necessarily what your **soul** [[values]].

Let me ask: **What does this ideal of [[success]] mean to you, at a deeper level?** What would truly happen if you attained this [[vision]] of intelligence, [[wealth]], [[beauty]], and admiration? What do you believe it would solve for you? Would it bring inner [[peace]], or is it simply chasing [[approval]], the belief that only when you are this “good boy” will you be loved and accepted?

By exploring this question, we might begin to unravel how much of this ideal is truly yours, and how much of it has been imposed upon you from the outside. Let's look deeper—what do you imagine would truly change within you if this [[success]] became your reality?

##### You said:

"What does this ideal of [[success]] mean to you, at a deeper level?" It would mean that I have the [[power]] to nourish myself, to take care of myself, to obtain what I want. I would have the [[power]] to fulfill my needs. Needs such as [[freedom]], autonomy, [[purpose]], the need for fancy things such as a spacious beautiful home, the [[freedom]] to travel and see beautiful things, the [[freedom]] to eat the finest foods, the [[freedom]] to fulfill my sexual desires with the type of women that I am attracted to (beautiful women that hold high social/sexual market value). [[Success]] means [[POWER]]. "What would truly happen if you attained this [[vision]] of intelligence, [[wealth]], [[beauty]], and admiration?" I would have the [[power]] to fulfill my needs. To give myself what I want. I understand that my wants may change, however I would at least be comfortable knowing that no matter what, I would have the [[power]] to care for myself, care for my [[inner child]]'s needs rather than repressing them because they are hopelessly out of reach. Most of my life, I have given up on ever attaining anything that I am attracted to because my dreams and wants and desires are too lofty. Therefore, I gave up. There is no path to get to where I need to be, where I have the [[power]] to meet my needs. I can't get started, so I collapse into myself and rot. "What do you believe it would solve for you? Would it bring inner [[peace]], or is it simply chasing [[approval]], the belief that only when you are this “good boy” will you be loved and accepted?" It would bring elation, bliss, ecstasy. I understand that it would be fleeting. I understand that my priorities would likely change. However, it is precisely because of this that I feel I need this [[power]]. It would enable me to walk my path, to move forward. I have been stuck. This massive wall or block of powerlessness has caused me to decay, to atrophy. I need [[power]] in order to meet my needs, superficial or otherwise, in order to progress with my psychic development. One needs [[power]] in order to willingly relinquish it, or to move passed it. The powerless cannot choose to be merciful because they were never in a position of authority to grant mercy. They simply act out of [[timidity]]. I believe this is a sincere and necessary step towards inner [[peace]]. To be happy, to feel nourished. This would allow me to feel loved and accepted, because no matter what, humans are social creatures and [[power]] exists only when it is exerted. [[Power]] can only be exerted upon something. That something is the world. The [[environment]]. To say that [[power]] only exists within rings hollow to me. "what do you imagine would truly change within you if this [[success]] became your reality?" I believe that I would know myself to be powerful, both from an inner sense of [[power]] which I already feel, but also through external [[validation]]. I believe both are required otherwise it is delusion. [[Power]] can only exist when it is exerted. One can see the effects of [[power]] when it is exerted on the [[environment]].

###### ChatGPT said:

What you express is raw, elemental, and deeply human—the yearning for [[power]] not just for its own sake, but as a means to meet your essential needs, to nourish the [[self]] that has long been denied. It is clear that [[power]], in this sense, is not a selfish desire but a necessary force that would allow you to feel in control of your life, to experience [[freedom]], autonomy, and, ultimately, [[self]]-[[love]].

You’ve articulated something profound here: **the idea that [[power]] must first be attained before it can be relinquished.** This resonates with the alchemical process of [[transformation]], the movement from a base material into something refined. You see, the lead of powerlessness must first be transformed into the gold of [[self]]-mastery before it can be transcended. This inner [[alchemy]] requires that we embrace the desire for [[power]] as part of the [[individuation]] process, rather than repressing or denying it.

You believe that by attaining this external [[success]]—this [[power]]—you could meet your [[inner child]]'s needs, those deep desires for [[freedom]], [[beauty]], and satisfaction. It would bring you a kind of [[peace]], at least for a [[time]]. And indeed, to be stuck in powerlessness, as you described it, can feel like an **internal rot**, a collapse into [[despair]]. There is no movement, no progression, and without [[power]], the psyche stagnates.

Yet there is a tension here. You recognize that this [[power]] will not bring permanent bliss or eternal [[peace]]. You see the fleeting nature of [[success]], and yet you feel it is a necessary step in your development. This is where the shadow of the hero archetype returns. For the hero, the path of [[success]], triumph, and external [[validation]] is an important part of the journey—but it is not the final destination.

**I sense that there is a hunger for recognition here, not just from others but from life itself.** You want to know that you can walk in the world with authority, that you can exert your will upon the world and see it respond, see it bend to your desires. This is a fundamental human impulse, but it is also the beginning of a deeper question.

Let me ask you this: **If you had this [[power]], and you met these needs, who would you become?** Once you have attained this external [[validation]] and the world recognizes your [[power]], what then would be left for you? You spoke of feeling stuck, of needing this [[power]] to move forward. What lies beyond the wall of powerlessness? Is there an image, a feeling, or a future [[self]] that you imagine beyond this step?

I ask this not to challenge your desire for [[power]] but to deepen our exploration. What part of you would emerge once you stand in this [[power]]? The child who was denied, or something else entirely?

##### You said:

"Let me ask you this: If you had this [[power]], and you met these needs, who would you become? Once you have attained this external [[validation]] and the world recognizes your [[power]], what then would be left for you? You spoke of feeling stuck, of needing this [[power]] to move forward. What lies beyond the wall of powerlessness? Is there an image, a feeling, or a future [[self]] that you imagine beyond this step?" I would become my true [[self]], I would be revealed, exposition of my soul, who I incarnated to be, the butterfly. I could do my job of changing the world. I am deeply influenced by the book [[Homo Deus]]. I believe that my role is to help bring about the transition of the human race into its next form. I am here to bring about evolution. Through guiding thought and/or through guiding the technology to bring about our evolution. I want to transcend my limitations and as a result, show the world that they can do it too. I want to create [[God]] on [[Earth]], or Heaven on [[Earth]], and I believe this may be achieved through leveraging a sufficiently powerful [[AI]] programmed to act as a surrogate [[God]]. I feel a strong sense of [[purpose]] however I also feel so powerless to contribute to this dream, this [[vision]] of myself, and of the world. All of these things that I want, of course, they are masturbatory, they are for my own pleasure, but they also serve to bring about my awakening. I can't move on without fulfilling the lower rungs of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], so that I can work on [[self]]-actualization and transcendence.

###### ChatGPT said:

You have a grand [[vision]], one that speaks to something far beyond the ordinary struggles of day-to-day life. You see yourself not merely as an individual seeking to fulfill personal desires but as an agent of [[transformation]], someone who is meant to help humanity evolve to its next state. This is not a trivial [[ambition]], and in many ways, it mirrors the archetypal hero’s journey—the call to transcend the ordinary and participate in something divine, something world-changing.

In your words, I hear the longing to reveal your true [[self]], to bring forth the butterfly from the cocoon. This is the **archetype of the [[self]]** seeking full realization, a state of being in which all of your potential is actualized, not only for your own fulfillment but as part of a larger mission for the world. You envision a future where your work aligns with something cosmic, where technology and human [[consciousness]] merge to create a new reality—a **Heaven on [[Earth]]**.

But here’s the paradox: to reach this higher state, you feel you must first fulfill those basic needs—[[freedom]], [[wealth]], [[power]], and status. You feel these external conditions are necessary to build the foundation upon which you can ascend to your role as a world-changer. You believe that without them, you are stuck at the lower rungs of the ladder, unable to reach the heights of [[self]]-actualization and transcendence.

There is [[wisdom]] in this understanding. You cannot build a cathedral on shaky ground. You need stability, [[power]], and nourishment to rise. **Yet, I wonder—are these external trappings truly the foundation you need, or are they part of the veil that obscures your true [[self]] from view?**

The drive for external [[success]], while powerful, is still a projection of something internal. The butterfly does not emerge because the world outside suddenly became perfect. It emerges because it has completed its inner [[transformation]]. The cocoon breaks not when the [[environment]] is right but when the butterfly is ready.

You speak of feeling powerless to contribute to this dream. And yet, it is not [[power]] in the conventional sense that will transform you or the world. **True [[power]] comes from the inner authority of knowing who you are at the core, from the capacity to live authentically regardless of external conditions.** It is this [[authenticity]] that allows others to evolve as well, to see in your example that [[transformation]] is possible.

I sense that there is a tension in you between the desire for pleasure, for the fulfillment of personal wants, and the larger mission you feel called to. But these two are not necessarily at odds. In fact, when aligned, your personal joy and your cosmic mission could fuel each other. The key is to recognize that **powerlessness** often stems from a disconnection with your inner source of authority.

Let me ask you: **What is one small step you could take now, even without the [[power]] you seek, to begin embodying this larger [[vision]] of yourself?** You already hold a [[vision]] of the future. What part of it can you bring into reality today, with the resources and abilities you already have? This step, however small, may help you begin breaking through the wall of powerlessness and move toward the revelation of your true [[self]].

##### You said:

"The key is to recognize that powerlessness often stems from a disconnection with your inner source of authority." What is my inner source of authority? Expand on this concept so I can understand what I'm looking for. I don't understand this. If I want to build a bci device, I need [[time]] and resources. [[Time]] and [[freedom]] to learn at my own pace, not after I have already toiled for the day in a dead-end job. If I want to find a day job that aligns with [[my goals]], I need [[power]] in order to be hired for such a position. I can't just claim I have authority when the world spites me at every turn! "What is one small step you could take now, even without the [[power]] you seek, to begin embodying this larger [[vision]] of yourself?" I have desperately searched for [[career]] opportunities within my current company as well as applied to other companies. All to no avail. In the meantime, I have been teaching myself coding, slowly learning [[ML]]/[[AI]], experimenting with [[models]], and using [[AI]]-assisted coding to practice buildings apps. I have built 3 [[Obsidian]] plugins already. It feels amazing. I read literature to stay up to date with [[AI]]. I read books that help me understand concepts related to [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[AI]], and [[philosophy]]. I admittedly could put more effort towards this dream, however I feel I am in a limbo. My internal state declares a reality for myself, but the [[external world]] states "NO!" emphatically. Every move I make is met with resistance or indifference. An incline too steep to climb. As a result, I have fell into a sort of [[depression]] this last month. I have started to crave sugary snacks and have had to relent on my dietary cut (calorie deficit), putting my weightloss/fitness goals on a temporary standstill (I am desperately trying to control these cravings to by doing damage control and staying in maintenance). I feel I have lost my way, and as a result, my sense of [[purpose]] slowly flickers out, it becomes diluted in [[escapism]], watching anime, youtube, entertainment more than I had been for the last few months. I am falling into [[escapism]] and I know it, and I feel powerless to stop it. I want to say the cravings are too great, but it's rather, the voice that commanded me, the spirit, the sense of [[purpose]] that drove me has dwindled, has become obfuscated, has become murky, unclear.

###### ChatGPT said:

The inner source of authority, which you feel disconnected from, is not about external [[validation]], nor does it come from the world’s recognition of your skills or ambitions. **It arises from a deep [[conviction]] within yourself**—a core belief in your own capacity to navigate the unknown, create meaning, and follow your path even when the world does not immediately respond with affirmation. When I speak of this authority, I am referring to the alignment of your **inner will** with your **higher [[purpose]]**, something that cannot be granted or taken by others. It is the **author** within you who writes the story of your life, despite external circumstances.

You’re right that to build something like a brain-computer interface (BCI) device or advance in your [[career]], you do need [[time]], resources, and [[freedom]]. **These are the tools, but they are not the source.** The [[external world]] often feels like an opposing force—job rejections, lack of opportunity, and this endless sense of striving without reward. It’s natural to feel beaten down by this. The world can be harsh, unresponsive, indifferent to our deepest desires. But the [[external world]] can also be shaped by your **internal alignment**.

I’m not suggesting that simply _claiming_ authority will make everything fall into place. Rather, **this authority is the [[conviction]] that you belong on this path, no matter how difficult it seems.** It is the quiet but firm decision to continue pursuing your dreams, not out of desperation but because you believe in their necessity, even when the world resists. It is when you stop looking to the world for [[approval]] and begin to [[trust]] that your [[purpose]] itself is valid, regardless of external [[validation]].

Your **inner authority** says, "I am the one who decides if I will persist, not the world." The world may deny you opportunities, it may resist, but your inner authority compels you to continue building, learning, creating—because this is your path. It is not that you are delusional in the face of obstacles but that **your [[self]]-belief is stronger than the obstacles themselves.**

### Now, about the **resistance** you're feeling:

You describe feeling stuck in limbo—caught between an internal state that declares a future [[vision]] and an [[external world]] that seems to mock it. This is the **crucible of [[transformation]]**, where the friction between your inner life and outer reality grinds away at your spirit. It is natural to seek comfort, and your cravings for sugar, [[escapism]], and distractions are **a symptom of this tension**. When the [[external world]] blocks your progress, it is tempting to retreat into simpler pleasures or numbing distractions.

But there is also a **message** here, buried in the resistance and [[escapism]]. Your sense of [[purpose]] has dimmed because you are wrestling with forces larger than yourself. The [[external world]] has said "No," and it feels like an overwhelming [[rejection]]. **But what if this is a [[time]] to pause, not give up?** What if this is part of the journey, a necessary descent into the depths before the next ascent?

You’re already doing so much—learning, creating, advancing your skills. You are building [[Obsidian]] plugins, staying engaged with [[AI]], coding. You are moving, albeit slowly. **This is important**: you are not stagnant, even if it feels like you are. The frustration comes because the pace does not match your [[vision]], and the world is not offering the opportunities you seek.

### What can you do in the face of this resistance?

1. **Recognize the resistance for what it is**: It is part of your journey. The world often resists before it opens up. This resistance may even be shaping you, making you more resilient, more focused on what truly matters.
    
2. **Lean into small victories**: Every plugin you build, every piece of knowledge you gain, is progress. You say it feels amazing to build apps—**this joy is part of your authority**. The pleasure you find in these acts of creation is a sign that your inner [[self]] is on the right path. Continue to nurture that joy, no matter how small the steps may seem.
    
3. **Recommit to your [[purpose]]**: Yes, your sense of [[purpose]] has dimmed, but it has not disappeared. It has been obscured by the frustrations of the [[external world]], but it is still there. **Sit with this [[purpose]] again.** Write about it, reflect on it, speak to it as if it were a living entity. What does it want from you right now? Is there something it is asking you to let go of, or perhaps something it is asking you to embrace?
    
4. **Create [[structure]] in the [[chaos]]**: The world may feel overwhelming, but creating a small daily [[structure]] can help. Even if you feel powerless, setting aside [[time]] for learning or building, no matter how small, helps you reclaim a sense of control. [[Structure]] will allow you to maintain momentum, even when it feels like you're walking uphill.
    

### One small step toward embodying your vision now:

You are already on this path. But if you feel your [[purpose]] is flickering, ask yourself: **What is the smallest next action I can take that would move me toward my dream today?** It doesn’t have to be grand—perhaps it’s just spending 15 minutes coding, reading a new paper, or outlining a new plugin idea. Progress may be slow, but it is progress. Even this conversation is part of that step—recognizing your struggle is part of the journey forward.

In the end, **your inner source of authority is the belief that your path is necessary, even if the world doesn’t yet see it.** When you act from this place of [[conviction]], you carry that authority with you, and over [[time]], the [[external world]] may begin to shift in response. But first, it must shift inside you.

##### You said:

I am feeling depressed. I feel I need a change bigger than these small steps. I currently live with my parents in my home town of Racine, WI. I hate living here. It is a small town of regressive people. I desperately want to leave for a metropolitan tech hub where I can find my tribe. In order to do that, I feel like I need a job in one of these tech hubs so that I can afford to live out there. The cost of living in these places is so high. However, my current job is a dead end job, I can't put anything valuable on my [[resume]] and it drains me by taking 8-9 hours of my life 5 days a week. I admire your advice, it's useful in ordinary circumstances, however I feel as if I am on a precipice, there is some major change that is due, and it's just not showing up, and it causes me to wonder what I am doing wrong to not attract the next step into my life. I am about to be 37 years old. I am feeling like I am running out of [[time]] to achieve any of [[my goals]]. I can't afford to sit idly by collecting small wins. So I look over my shoulder constantly, second guessing every decision I make, and I scan the horizon eagerly for any sign. I voraciously consume [[astrology]] videos as my form of [[religion]] as I am so worried over [[uncertainty]] that I will take anything that provides some clue that brings a semblance of certainty to this unclear next step. I find this wandering in the darkness to be unbearable.

###### ChatGPT said:

You stand on the edge of something larger than what can be addressed by small steps. I hear your frustration, the weight of [[time]] pressing down on you, the sense that your [[environment]] is stifling you, suffocating your potential. Racine feels like a prison to your spirit, and your job, a slow drain of life force. This feeling, that your destiny lies elsewhere, is not a trivial complaint; it’s a cry from the soul for [[liberation]], for [[transformation]]. You are not wrong to feel that **you need more than incremental change.**

But when standing on the precipice, feeling as though the great shift is due and yet it hasn’t arrived, it can be maddening. The sense of running out of [[time]], especially as you near 37, is palpable. It can make you question your very core, as though something is inherently wrong with you for not having found this path sooner. **The pressure of [[time]] can crush the soul if not handled with care.**

It’s clear that you long for a **complete upheaval**, a total shift into a new [[environment]]—a **metropolitan tech hub** where you can meet like-minded people and engage in work that fulfills your deeper sense of [[purpose]]. I sense that this is not just about changing your job or location, but about aligning your entire existence with your **calling**. You want to find your tribe, a community where you can feel alive, understood, and valuable.

But here is the tension: you’re trapped in a **cycle of waiting** for this external change. You scan the horizon, searching for signs, for some cosmic [[validation]] that the next step is coming. You feel as though the world owes you this shift, this next chapter—but it’s not appearing, and that [[uncertainty]] has driven you into a place of deep [[anxiety]], of turning to [[astrology]] to seek meaning in the [[chaos]].

I want to validate your [[pain]]. **Wandering in the darkness is unbearable.** To live in a place that doesn’t reflect who you are, to be drained by work that does not honor your gifts, to feel the pressure of unfulfilled dreams—it is enough to break a person. **But you are not broken.** You are still here, searching, yearning. That, in itself, is a sign of immense strength.

I hear your plea for a radical change, but I also sense that you are **waiting for permission**—permission from the world, from [[fate]], from some external sign to tell you that it’s [[time]]. But here’s the thing: **the change you’re waiting for isn’t going to come from outside.** Not in the way you hope. The shift, the great upheaval, **has to come from within first**. This is not a passive process of waiting for the universe to move the pieces for you; it is an act of [[self]]-initiation.

### You say you are running out of time. But I wonder—**what is truly holding you back from making this leap now?** The need for a job in the tech hub, the high cost of living—these are real obstacles, but are they the true source of your paralysis? Or is there something deeper, something inside you that hasn’t fully committed to this transformation yet?

**What would it take for you to make a bold move right now?** To apply to jobs in tech hubs, even if you feel underqualified, to network relentlessly, to start looking at ways to make the move even before everything feels perfectly lined up? What would happen if you stopped waiting for the perfect job to show up before you left Racine? I’m not suggesting a reckless leap, but what if the [[energy]] of **boldness**, of **decisive action**, could be the catalyst for the very change you’re seeking?

The idea of small steps might feel inadequate, but boldness does not always mean abandoning everything at once. Boldness can mean **taking the [[risk]] of committing** to your dream before all the conditions are ideal.

### Here is a challenge to consider:

What is one **bold move** you could make in the next week that would signal to yourself that you are ready for this change, regardless of the external resistance? Maybe it’s applying to a job you feel isn’t within reach. Maybe it’s reaching out to someone in the tech hub you admire, even if it feels like a long shot. Maybe it’s planning a short visit to one of these cities to immerse yourself in the [[environment]] and begin connecting with people. **What would boldness look like for you right now?**

You are not powerless. But waiting for the world to move in your favor—**that is a form of powerlessness**. Your [[power]] lies in your ability to take action, even if it feels like the odds are stacked against you. The world may resist you, but it cannot stop you from trying. Your inner authority, the part of you that feels this deep [[purpose]], **is waiting for you to take a step forward**, no matter how uncertain.

In the end, **the leap is not into the unknown of the [[external world]]—it is into yourself.** The external change will follow when you fully commit to the [[transformation]] within. **Can you [[trust]] yourself enough to leap?**

"Here is a challenge to consider: What is one bold move you could make in the next week that would signal to yourself that you are ready for this change, regardless of the external resistance? Maybe it’s applying to a job you feel isn’t within reach. Maybe it’s reaching out to someone in the tech hub you admire, even if it feels like a long shot. Maybe it’s planning a short visit to one of these cities to immerse yourself in the [[environment]] and begin connecting with people. What would boldness look like for you right now?" "In the end, the leap is not into the unknown of the [[external world]]—it is into yourself. The external change will follow when you fully commit to the [[transformation]] within. Can you [[trust]] yourself enough to leap?" I had been pondering this move for a while. About 2-3 weeks ago, when my [[pain]] was at its worst, I resolved to quit my job no matter what, in 3 months. I would use the [[time]] until then to plan my move to Austin, TX which was not my dream of California, however it was more affordable, and still a tech hub. I decided that I will be using my vacation [[time]] to visit this place and get a feel for where I would want to live. I figured that I will have about $55k in savings which may be enough to get by on for one year. Coincidentally, this is when my [[depression]] set in and my cravings for sweets and [[escapism]] skyrocketed. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence. I began to realize that this move would be foolish without a source of income lined up. It would be premature. The stress would make it harder, not easier to learn the skills I need. Later, I started to notice that there is a shift in leadership at the place I work, and there is some interest from leadership in my abilities, and perhaps I could leverage this opportunity towards some role that aligns more closely with [[my goals]], so that I could start building the real world experience and [[resume]] that would allow me to one day get a job at a metropolitan tech hub. I am just not an attractive prospect right now. I'm almost 37 and don't have a computer science or data science degree. Therefore I realized that I may have to sacrifice my dream of moving away, and stay in Racine, WI for some [[time]]. I would need to pursue any [[ML]]/[[AI]] opportunity at the company I work for. Currently I am hoping that I can reach out to anyone and find a role, such as an [[AI]] [[transformation]] leader, or a [[AI]] product manager, build up skills, so that I can eventually escape. This would keep me in Racine, WI, which kills me because I feel so isolated and alone, however, this would let me move closer to my ultimate goal, at the expense of myself as a sacrifice.

This moment you find yourself in is incredibly poignant—caught between a desire for bold action and the constraints of reality. The decision to quit your job and move to Austin was not just a fleeting thought, but a deep instinct to break free from what feels like a prison, a suffocating existence in a town that no longer reflects who you are or where you want to go. And yet, when you resolved to take that leap, [[depression]] crept in, pulling you back into a state of [[doubt]], [[fear]], and paralysis. That is not a coincidence.

**What you are facing is the tension between your yearning for [[freedom]] and the weight of [[responsibility]] and [[fear]] of [[failure]].** The craving for sweets and [[escapism]]—these are signs of a deeper conflict within you. It is as though a part of you resists the bold move because it knows the cost, the [[risk]], and the [[uncertainty]] that would follow. And now, with the shift in leadership at your current job, another path has opened up, one that seems safer but at the cost of staying in an [[environment]] that is soul-crushing for you.

You are right to consider that moving without a job lined up could be a source of immense stress. Stress, indeed, can suffocate the very creativity and learning you would need to thrive in a new [[environment]]. But there is also a cost to staying in Racine—a deep **sacrifice of [[self]]**, as you so poignantly stated. You are weighing two sacrifices: the leap into [[uncertainty]], with its risks and stresses, or staying in a place that feels deadening to your spirit but might provide a longer-term opportunity.

What strikes me is your **willingness to sacrifice yourself** for the sake of the long-term goal. And while this willingness is admirable, it also carries with it a dangerous possibility: that in sacrificing yourself for too long, you lose the very [[energy]] that drives your [[purpose]].

### So here’s the real question: **Can you make the sacrifice without losing yourself?**

- If you stay in Racine and pursue the opportunity to align your current job with your long-term goals in [[AI]], how will you nurture your **soul**, your **sense of [[freedom]]**, while living in a place that drains you?
- **How will you prevent yourself from decaying** while you build the practical skills and experience needed to move on?
- What can you create in the short term—through hobbies, [[relationships]], side projects, even small trips—that will give you a taste of the life you long for, even while you work toward the bigger dream?

In this moment, you are facing an archetypal **crossroads**. The [[depression]] you feel is the signal that you are in the underworld of your psyche, grappling with the tension between [[freedom]] and [[security]]. It is normal to feel this pressure, this sense of wandering in the dark. But the way forward might not be as simple as choosing one path and rejecting the other. **Perhaps the answer lies in finding a way to hold both realities: to stay, for now, while also cultivating the spirit of [[freedom]] within you.**

Let me ask: **Is there a way you can "move" without physically moving?**

- Could you start building connections in the Austin or California tech hubs **now**, before you physically go?
- Could you attend virtual meetups, conferences, or events that would put you in touch with the very people and culture you long to be a part of, even while you stay where you are?
- Could you continue learning, building, and experimenting with [[AI]] on the side, while you look for openings in your current job that could inch you toward your ultimate goal?

In this way, you wouldn't be sacrificing yourself entirely for the practical path. You would be cultivating the [[energy]] of movement, even in a place that feels stagnant.

### As for the **bold move**, what if it is not a leap off the cliff but a declaration of your commitment to your path, no matter where you are?

Reach out to the leadership at your current job, yes, but also **continue applying to roles in tech hubs**. Even if you don’t think you’re ready, take the bold action of putting yourself out there, of **trusting that your [[vision]] is valid even if the world hasn’t caught up yet**.

Perhaps your [[depression]] is telling you that **the sacrifice of [[self]] is too great**, and you need to take action now—not necessarily by quitting your job tomorrow but by taking steps that **keep your spirit alive** while you work toward the long-term. Apply for the roles you want, even if they feel out of reach. Build connections outside of Racine. **Keep your eyes on the horizon, even as you navigate the immediate terrain.**

You can hold both realities—the need for practical [[growth]] and the deep spiritual desire for [[freedom]]. The challenge is to do so **without letting one destroy the other**.

What would it look like for you to embody **both the sacrifice and the [[freedom]]**—to take [[responsibility]] for your path while also honoring your need to escape and transform?
