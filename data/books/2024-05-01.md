# Daily Law
## Everyone Is a Player in the Game

> Courts are, unquestionably, the seats of politeness and good breeding; were they not so, they would be the seats of slaughter and desolation. Those who now smile upon and embrace, would affront and stab, each other, if manners did not interpose.
> 
> —Lord Chesterfield

You can recognize supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of [[justice]]. But since all of us hunger for [[power]], and almost all of our actions are aimed at gaining it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in our eyes, distracting us from their [[power]] plays. If you observe them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at indirect manipulation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day.

> Daily Law: The world is like a giant scheming court and we are all trapped inside it. **There is no opting out of the game. Everyone is playing.**

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: List three things you’re grateful for about your physical health.

My endurance has increased. I am grateful for not being out of breath traversing physical space. I am a physical being and I’m proud of it.

My muscles. I am gaining musculature. I am gaining a body that I can be proud of aesthetically, but also functionally. I have less to no [[pain]], including less to no [[pain]] in my left hip.

My energy. I use caffeine however I don’t think I require it. I have enough energy to wake up, go to work, and then come home and go to the gym.

# Social [[anxiety]] 
You will make many mistakes, you both have [[trauma]] which distorts your perception of external signals while also having innate Martian aggression (a malefic force). You are fucked both from within and without. 

*Instead of grasping through [[regret]], calibrate and move on. It's all you can do. Accept the hand you were dealt, it can't be any other way as a matter of fact.* 

## [[Four Causes]]
The above is due to my 
- **material** cause - the psychic objects I am made from, the psychic objects that I inherited from my ancestors. Genetic predisposition.
- **formal** cause - it is the arrangement of those psychic objects. 
- **efficient** cause - *what brought this scenario* (impediment of social anxiety) *into being*. The arrangement of my psyche was shaped environmentally, through my experiences, epigenetics, as well as my material cause, the psychic objects I was made from. Ultimately, this interaction of internal and external forces defines [[karma]]. 
- **final** cause - why I am socially anxious? *What is the ultimate [[purpose]] of this scenario*? [[Karma]]. Development of the soul.

# You’re afraid of a feeling
[[Julien Blanc]]
[](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/r0JLpAPcOYI&t=0) you're not afraid of speaking you're afraid of the feeling or whatever might be getting triggered within you around speaking hey go speak in front of the crowd I can't I can't the the experience the feeling experience is what you fear not the speaking itself the same with people like I'm scared of getting rejected no you aren't you're scared of sitting with the feeling that might get poked at or activated when you get rejected but in the end all of your fears all of them come down to a basic feeling you not willing to sit with something that might not be comfortable and this is why I keep talking about letting go it's letting go of your resistance around feeling 

All negative [[emotion]]al responses are manifestations of a single emotional response to [[discomfort]]. Your need to reject [[discomfort]]. Your unwillingness to sit with your [[discomfort]]. 
	This primal emotional response may be our first negative experience as it could relate to the [[discomfort]] felt when a newborn leaves the womb through birth and takes its first breath. I imagine the nice warm womblike state where all needs are taken care of by the mother is replaced by a cold sharp alien [[environment]]. This reaction to this initial [[discomfort]] may shape our lives. Especially for those that were struck to make the baby take its first breath.
