# Daily Law
## Deciphering the Shadow

In the course of your life you will come upon people who have very emphatic traits that set them apart and seem to be the source of their strength—unusual [[confidence]], exceptional niceness and affability, great moral rectitude and a saintly aura, toughness and rugged masculinity, an intimidating intellect. If you look closely at them, you may notice a slight exaggeration to these traits, as if they were performing or laying it on just a little too thick. As a student of human nature, you must understand the reality: the emphatic trait generally rests on top of the opposite trait, distracting and concealing it from public view. We can see two forms of this: Early on in life some people sense a softness, [[vulnerability]], or [[insecurity]] that might prove embarrassing or uncomfortable. They unconsciously develop the opposite trait, a [[resilience]] or toughness that lies on the outside like a protective shell. The other scenario is that a person has a quality that they feel might be antisocial—for instance, too much [[ambition]] or an inclination to be selfish. They develop the opposite quality, something very prosocial. In both cases, over the years they hone and perfect this public image. The underlying weakness or antisocial trait is a key component of their Shadow—something denied and repressed. But as the laws of human nature dictate, the deeper the repression, the greater the volatility of the Shadow.

> Daily Law: Be extra wary around people who display emphatic traits. It is very easy to get caught up in the appearance and first impression. Watch for the signs and emergence of the opposite over time.

## [[Pain]] point: followers suffer the consequences of poor leadership

At SCJ, everyone knows that Winshuttle is a [[failure]] yet PMO keeps trying to push Winshuttle as a necessity. They state that Supply Chain has incorporated it into their process and that it keeps them out of Excel and Outlook. The rest of the company needs to suffer due to duplicate work. They are forced to use a tool, a product, that instead of relieving their [[pain]], actually causes more [[pain]].

Union of yin/yang, masculine/feminine. Later made feminine to pair with dragon who is traditionally masculine.

## [Garuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda)

Garuda and Aruna are brothers. Their mother broke Aruna’s egg prematurely and Aruna cursed her that she would be enslaved, which eventually came to pass due to a lost bet. Garuda later asked his serpent brothers (the naga) to free his mother but they demanded [[amrit]] from heaven.

> “Garuda waged a war against gods with his extraordinary might and abilities beyond thinking, and defeated all of them, including [Indra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra "Indra"). He then took Indra's nectar vessel and flew back to [[earth]]. 
> 
> Vishnu then came to Garuda, and asked him to be his ride, to which he agreed. Indra requested that Garuda not give the [Amrita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amrita "Amrita") to the [Nagas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga "Nāga") though, as it would bring great trouble later, so they forged a plan. Upon reaching his brothers Garuda placed the vessel before them, and asked them to first purify themselves before drinking. Meanwhile, [Jayanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayanta "Jayanta") (the son of Indra) stole the vessel back. On returning, the nagas were all devoured by Garuda.”

Throughout the Mahabharata, Garuda is invoked as a symbol of impetuous violent force, speed, and martial prowess. Powerful warriors advancing rapidly on doomed foes are likened to Garuda swooping down on a serpent. Defeated warriors are like snakes beaten down by Garuda. The Mahabharata character [Drona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drona "Drona") uses a military formation named after Garuda. [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna "Krishna") carries the image of Garuda on his banner.

### Bird metaphors
  
A remarkable number of poets have mentioned birds in their poetry. Among these mentions are their singing, flying low or high, falling into traps, losing their partners, getting injured, breaking their wings or being hunted, residing in vineyards, gardens and green areas, being locked in a cage, being scared off with stones, and being timid, weak, hungry and without shelter in the cold

  
The reason why a symbolic language is preferred in Eastern literature is to avoid misunderstandings in texts that handle Sufi themes. A curtain of metaphor relays the intended messages while creating an interesting story.

#### ‘The Conference of the Birds’ by Attar
Sufi

The _Conference of the Birds_ begins with the birds of the world gathering at a summit in order to seek a king. They turn to the wise _hoopoe_ for guidance, who tells them that they should acknowledge the Great Simorgh as their king, but that the journey to his court is long and perilous, and filled with trials and tests. At first, the birds are excited to embark on this quest, but begin to make excuses to stay behind when they realize the quest’s difficulty. The _hoopoe_ addresses each of their hesitations, fears, vanities, and questions with parables and anecdotes that counter each of their individual concerns. The birds formally adopt the _hoopoe_ as their leader, and the _hoopoe_ describes the seven valleys they must cross in order to reach the Great Simorgh’s court: the Valley of the Quest, the Valley of [[Love]], the Valley of [[Insight]] into Mystery, the Valley of [[Detachment]], the Valley of Unity, the Valley of Bewilderment, and, finally, the Valley of Poverty and Nothingness. Many of the birds are distressed by the _hoopoe_’s words and some even die of fright, but despite their apprehensions, the birds begin their journey.

In the Valley of the Quest, the travelers must cast aside all dogma, belief, and unbelief to open their minds to possibility. 

They continue to the Valley of [[Love]], where they must abandon reason and embrace passionate [[love]] with a full heart. 

From there, they reach the Valley of [[Insight]] into Mystery, where the birds must accept the uselessness of worldly knowledge and open their minds to a new way of thinking. 

In the fourth valley, the Valley of [[Detachment]], all worldly desires and attachments must be relinquished and assumptions of the nature of reality must vanish. 

The Valley of Unity commands the birds to realize that everything is connected and that the divine [[power]] of the Beloved is beyond everything known. 

They continue to the Valley of Bewilderment, where the birds are both perplexed and in awe of the Beloved, which allows them to realize everything they knew before this point was meaningless. 

Finally, in the Valley of Poverty and Nothingness (annihilation), the [[self]] disappears into the universe and the travelers are no longer confined by linear time; instead, they exist in both the past and the future. Many birds perish along the journey, and by the end only thirty birds remain. 

The _hoopoe_ guides them to a lake, where they see the Simorgh in their own reflections. The Great Simorgh, and the divine leadership they were seeking, was within them all along, as the name Simorgh, meaning thirty (_si_) birds _(morgh)_ attests.
# Donald Rumsfeld on [[Knowledge]]

1. **Known knowns:** Things we know that we know. These are clear and understood facts.
2. **Known unknowns:** Things we know that we don't know. These are recognized gaps in our knowledge.
3. **Unknown knowns:** Things we don't know that we know. These are assumptions or knowledge that we possess but are unaware of its relevance or existence.
4. **Unknown unknowns:** Things we don't know that we don't know. These are unexpected and unforeseen factors that we are completely unaware of.
