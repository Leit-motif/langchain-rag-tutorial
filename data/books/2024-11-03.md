# Journal

I'm feeling impatient because my weight loss isn't going as fast as I want it to. Yes, I understand that I just started cutting again, but still, it feels demotivating. Not sad, I don't feel as sad about it anymore, now it's just a smaller amount of impatience. 

# Talking with my father
frustrated
having goals
wanting the remote
avoiding confronting the one thing he was supposed to do
cursing me, those around him weaponizing the concept of [[karma]]
wanting to run away by hiding under the covers
wanting to reminisce with figures from his past as well as wanting to catch up on where they are in the present
[[rage]] against god: the time when prayers would have been useful were "back then", it's too late now
frustration with inability to use the phone
read a book of  quotes but only remembered leaving the house without keys
raged against my mom for taking away the remote, claimed she did it out of a large ego and abuse of power against him
Accused me of frivolously wasting my time

The biggest takeaway is that you can't use aversion as an instigator because you will always run into resistance which will result in a negative emotion. Therefore if you start with running away from a negative emotion, your mind expects that it's moving towards a positive emotion. The mind gets confused when it instead runs into a negative emotion, and therefore the motion, movement, momentum is lost. You cannot be bounced between two negatives, there needs to be a dialectic.

Start with appetitive drives only. Rid yourself with aversive drives. This is toxic fuel. It's better to just sit in nothingness than it is to run away. The nothingness will yield to what's next. 


# Motivational Interviewing
Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a collaborative, person-centered counseling approach designed to strengthen someone's own motivation and commitment to change. Here are the key components:

Core Principles (RULE):

1. Resist the righting reflex (avoid telling people what to do)
2. Understand the person's own motivations
3. Listen with empathy
4. Empower the person

Four Processes:

1. Engaging - establishing a trusting relationship
2. Focusing - identifying the specific change to discuss
3. Evoking - drawing out the person's own motivations for change
4. Planning - developing concrete steps forward

Key Skills (OARS):

1. Open-ended Questions
2. Affirmations
3. Reflective Listening
4. Summarizing

Key Concepts:

- Change Talk: Person's own statements supporting change
- Sustain Talk: Arguments against change
- Ambivalence: Normal part of the change process
- Rolling with Resistance: Working with rather than against resistance

The goal is to help people resolve ambivalence and find their own reasons for change, rather than imposing change upon them. The counselor guides the conversation while the client provides the content and direction for change.

Common Applications:

- Addiction treatment
- Health behavior change
- Mental health
- Professional development
- Parenting interventions

The only thing we can control is whether we beat ourselves or not during the process.
