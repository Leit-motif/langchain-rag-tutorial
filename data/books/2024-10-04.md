# Journal

Today I continued to wrestle with my decision. I am feeling karmic retribution. It appears that there's a lot of [[resentment]] against me and I feel betrayed. I [[fear]] that I have fostered it. I feel as if it is my fault. I just thought that perhaps this is a cycle I engage in. I use people to fuel my [[narcissism]], to fuel my ego which powers my will and drive, and then at some point, I outlive my welcome, and everyone becomes resentful. I don't know what I'm going to do. It seems that Kim and Caitlin look down on me now, for no reason. Nothing about me has changed. It's Kendra who has changed the demeanor of the team. However, was it me that caused others to feel inferior about their job? I feel the way I feel. I am the way I am. Again, dimming my light is not the answer.

I feel the same way that I did in high school when I broke up with [[Madeline]] and became an outcast.

Again I felt this way in my guild in WoW.

Again I felt this way with [[Victoria]].

This is a cycle, however I was truly just being myself this [[time]]. I contributed everything. The issue is that I wasn't in alignment with where/who I was with. I didn't agree, and I still don't agree. This [[time]] I was not looking down on people, I was legitimately shining and trying to be the best possible person I could be. People didn't like a person that shined. People didn't like a person that represented change. 

# Leo

I watched the video by Rick Levine regarding things you may not know about Zodiac signs. For [[Leo]], he explained the image that [[Leo]] needs to [[love]] in order to overcome the [[fear]] and [[anxiety]] from not receiving [[validation]] from others. He mentioned [[the Sun]] is the center of the solar system, however if it doesn't see itself reflected back in adoring planets, it feels horrible to the [[Leo]].
