# Daily Law
## The Grandiose Leader

The trick grandiose leaders play is to place the emphasis on their cultural tastes, not on the actual class they come from. They may fly first class and wear the most expensive suits, but they counteract this by seeming to have the same culinary tastes as the public, enjoy the same movies as others, and avoid at all costs the whiff of cultural elitism. In fact, they will go out of their way to ridicule the elites, even though they probably depend on such experts to guide them. They are simply just like the common folk out there, but with a lot more money and [[power]]. The public can now identify with them despite the obvious contradictions. But the grandiosity of this goes beyond merely gaining more attention. These leaders become vastly enlarged by this identification with the masses. They are not merely one man or woman but embody an entire nation or interest group. To follow them is to be loyal to the group itself. To criticize them is to want to crucify the leader and betray the cause. Even in the prosaic corporate world of business we find such religious-style identification. If you notice such paradoxes and primitive forms of popular association, stand back and analyze the reality of what is going on. You will find at the core something quasi-mystical, highly irrational, and quite dangerous in that the grandiose leader now feels licensed to do whatever he or she wants in the name of the public.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Write about a time when you overcame [[self]]-[[doubt]].

Today, for a moment, I hesitated before talking to Craig and Smita. I didn’t know whether I would be judged, I didn’t know what to say, I just didn’t know what to do. However, to my relief, it was for just a split-second and I just chose to act. Because of the timing, I realized that I didn’t have much time to think and therefore I didn’t have time to hamster. 

It was a fruitful conversation and revealed some networking opportunity.
