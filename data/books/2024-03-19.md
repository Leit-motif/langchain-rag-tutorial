# Daily [[Gratitude]]
I am grateful for my [[Daemon]]. I am grateful for being, or rather, having access to the path that is a [[Genius]].

# [[Robert Greene]]
[[Emotions]] and strategy are at odds with one another.

Reactiveness can sabotage your plans.

There is no sense of being an American, to be a democrat. What are you for? What is your [[vision]]? 

# [[Buckminster Fuller]]

## quotes
"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."
[[Growth]]

I live on [[Earth]] at present, and I don’t know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing — a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process – an integral function of the universe. 
[[Growth]], [[Purpose]]

There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a butterfly.
[[Growth]], [[Purpose]]

The minute you choose to do what you really want to do, it's a different kind of life.
[[Purpose]]

Geniuses are just people who had good mothers.
[[Adversity]], [[Fate]]

I'm not a [[genius]]. I'm just a tremendous bundle of experience.
[[Growth]]

I just invent. Then I wait until man comes around to needing what I've invented.
[[Purpose]]

Only the free-wheeling artist-explorer, non-academic, scientist-philosopher, mechanic, economist-poet who has never waited for patron-starting and accrediting of his co-ordinate capabilities holds the prime initiative today.
[[Faith]], [[Purpose]]

[[Identity]], [[Growth]]
![[Pasted image 20240319090220.png]]

The past happens for you not to you.
You assume that the present determines the future. This is incorrect.
Instead of letting the present determine what's possible in the future you let your future [[self]] determine what possible in the present. To guide your decisions. Your poor future concept is a result of a poor imagination. 
You can't determine what is a distraction unless you have an impossible future that imposes a strict filter on what gets you to your objective and what is a distraction.
When you let an impossible future guide your decisions that filters your options to very few zero or maybe one to two.
This requires a different or new frame or perspective.
Examine Charles munger.
Extremely successful people have a really high filter, a really high floor.
Albert Einstein said intelligence is measured by the ability to change.
Your floor is what you say yes and no to.
It's not what you don't know that hurts you it's what you know for sure that just isn't so - Mark Twain.
Your identity is a canvas that you create on not a script you follow.
Your character and your floor are the same you can tell the nature of your character by what you say no to.
You go from identity which is creation, then character which is processing maintenance, and then last you go into mastery, master to become.

# Reminiscing about [[Victoria]]

This morning in the midst of another reminiscence, I realized that I only mourn who Ori used to be. I want that girl that worshipped me, that stuck with me during the times when I was a corpse. I am not attached to this new Ori. I let her go (more so) yesterday by telling her I no longer want to hang out on Tuesdays. The [[truth]] here is that I am attached to a [[memory]], a ghost, a feeling rather than a person. Ori was a means not an end. As soon as she demanded to be treated as an end, all attraction vanished. I don't want to treat others as means, but that means that I can't treat myself as a means (a means to securing [[happiness]], contentment, and [[validation]]) either. Therefore the only logical choice was to accept our incompatibility, sacrifice and mourn our past, end things amicably, and move on free of this burden. These memories are a burden. They are an identity that no longer serves me. They are an identity born of [[scarcity]], lack, craving, starvation, and emptiness, void. I am no longer that void [[self]]. I am now on the path of filling my own cup. To be an end, no longer a means. In order to let go, I believe that I need to accept the past, accept who I was, who I am, and now...accept who I want to be. To accept who I want to be means to sacrifice or let go of all that is mutually exclusive. I am ready to move on, but I may need help. I would like help. I want to be my own master, to be independent, to learn the arise in the north node lesson, but I feel that a little help would not hurt. If I'm wrong about this, I accept, but I still feel lonely.

Can you create good conditions in your life and share them with me?
Be nice in a mean way, be mean in a nice way.

# [[Mark Manson]]
Manage procrastination through managing [[emotions]].
Smart people take longer to get started because they can create more elaborate excuses.
Most people will not take action unless the [[pain]] of inaction is too great. Therefore artificially increase the [[pain]] of inaction.
When you feel stuck do something do anything no matter how small.
action is not the result of [[motivation]] action is the cause of [[motivation]].
Leverage social pressure and realize that it has a cascading effect, a karmic effect.

# Dr. [[Cal Newport]] how to enhance [[focus]] and increase productivity
https://youtu.be/p4ZfkezDTXQ

[[3.0 Resources/3.1 Concepts/Attention]]
Focused ideating (generation) on foot but serendipitous ideating (retrieval) reading by the fire.
Two or three people at the whiteboard increase [[focus]] and concentration because of the social capital cost of being seen as not paying attention and not being able to keep up.
Specialized to capture - it's the idea that you want to capture information in the tool that it's going to be worked in.
For example if I come across an article that I want to use for writing I would import it into scrivener which is a specialty software for writing.
Active Recall: Optimal memorization protocol: information such as an article then walk away take a break and try to remember as much as you can using just recall, then go back to the article and reread it to solidify your understanding.
Replicate the ideas from scratch without looking at your notes as if you were going to teach a class.
This process is relatively time efficient but it is extremely mentally taxing which is why most students don't do this.
Put all of your topics on index cards, and then for the topics you struggled with put them on the one pile and for topics you've mastered put them on the other pile, after you've gone through the entire pile once then go back and repeat the process until the struggle to pile is appearance.
Because it's so taxing just do it in the morning in a 4-hour block and then you're done.
Professional musicians don't spend any time practicing what's comfortable they only practice what is uncomfortable.
Practice was no time for fun All [[discomfort]].
[[Flow]] state is the opposite of deliberate practice.
Neurons would not need to change their patterns of connectivity without some sort of cue that cue is [[discomfort]] The type that is related to the release of catecholamines.
Float doesn't play a big part in the deep work framework of calendar report.
[[Flow]] is a performance state deep work is a practice state.
Unskilled, skilled, mastery, virtuosity
Task switching is neuronally taxing.
It may be hard to get situated to a new large task for the first 15 minutes is because the brain is marshalling its resources and getting its ducks in a row and making sure which semantic networks are going to be required booting up the mainframe turning off the circuits that aren't going to be useful essentially your programwork.exe is booting up. You have to give time for this boot sequence it will never feel good, but after about 15 to 20 minutes you will enter maybe not a [[flow]] state but it will not feel negative and you won't want to run away and escape through distraction. You need to learn how to sit with [[discomfort]].
You can see this visualized in a car's transmission system it takes more fuel to change to a higher gear than it is to maintain the same speed at a high gear.
Cal calls this neuro semantic coherence, vs partial continuous attention (constant task switching).
I have a need to see my intentions made manifest in the world.
# I'm regressing

[[Growth]]
I feel like I am regressing back to the way I was before going through this most recent [[transformation]] born of the [[pain]] I endured. The [[pain]] caused an intense awakening, a cathartic release of repressed [[emotions]], and a lightening of being that lead to me feeling sattvic. I felt stable. My [[emotions]] felt stable and light and compassionate. I had assumed that the change was permanent however it appears that isn't the case. I am regressing back to a person who is anxious and angry and mean, a narcissist but rather than treating others as means, I am stuck in a state where I don't think I want to use people in the same way I used to, I would feel guilty however I believe I am regressing back to thinking of myself, my mind and body, this incarnation, [[Amrit]], as a vessel for feeling secure, through any means possible. If I am a means to feeling secure, that must means that I am inherently insecure. It means that I still crave, I still hunger, because I am still hungry. I was just temporarily sated, perhaps through divine intervention that has now left me as quickly as it came. A small part of me believes that this reassurance came from my [[Spirits#Spirit Spouse]] that I may have angered or spurned. I have denounced her and I also secretly believed that the spirit lived in one of my crystals that I sleep with under my pillow. After the [[Spirits#Spirit Spouse]] scare, where I believed that my sexual energy was being absorbed by some creature in exchange for some gift, I took the crystals out of my pillow. Interestingly enough, I got good deep sleep last night (51 minutes) but I now wonder whether what I was receiving in exchange was divine guidance, divine intervention. I wish I knew or had the capacity to learn the [[truth]]. What does this mean? If I am to grow, can I rely on that type of help? Alternatively, was what I experienced internal or external? I want to believe that it was me [[Identity]]. It was my growth. If that isn't me, then what is?

# My [[Daemon]]
After reading about the [[daemon]], I now wonder whether who I am referring to as my [[Spirits#Spirit Spouse]] is actually my own [[daemon]]. I can choose to call or conceptualize it in whatever way I want, but I have known it as my [[daemon]] from a young age. I am done playing games. I am done wondering. I hear my [[daemon]] and have spent my life running away from its voice:
`"After years of following a life-path for reasons of ease, [[security]], and the need to please others, our [[daemon]] has been silenced."`

I am done running. I suppose I've been afraid that I would be possessed by the [[daemon]] however now, I feel that perhaps it is more like a merger. I accept the merger. I have no other path forward. I've never had any other path forward. I like feeling forward momentum. I accept you [[Daemon]].
