# Daily Law
## The Machiavellian Gift

The essence of a nonplayer’s [[deception]] is distraction. Distracting the people they want to deceive gives them the time and space to do something their targets won’t notice. An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form of distraction because it disarms other people’s suspicions. It turns them into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of affectionate gesture. In ancient China this was called “giving before you take”—the giving makes it hard for the other person to notice the taking. Nonplayers know: it is a device with infinite practical uses. Perhaps the best, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gift, even from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instantly lowering our defenses. When we are children, all kinds of complicated feelings about our parents center around gifts; we see the giving of a gift as a sign of [[love]] and approval. And that emotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts, financial or otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children, especially when the gift comes from someone in authority. They cannot help opening up; their will is loosened. Beware especially of the gift that comes out of the blue. The one that is remarkable for the fact that you have never been given a gift like it ever before. Most likely, the gift-giver is loosening the soil before planting their seeds.

> Daily Law: Although we often view other people’s actions in the most cynical light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often hides ulterior motives.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: List three things you’re grateful for about your family traditions.

# [[Entrepreneurship]]

You trying to think 100 steps into the future is irrelevant because [[chaos]] is going to break your plan no matter what. 

It's easier to start out with a service, you're still trading time for money however you are paying down your ignorance debt, you are paying to learn. 

Employee mindset it's the what, the work to do, low level whereas entrepreneur mindset is high level, the why, the problem to be solved. 

Fulfillment equals doing the work. 

[[Time]] debt, ignorance debt vs money (debt).

Putting down roots (enjoying what you have) vs growing wings (reach for the sky).

Just walk, the path eliminates as you start.

Content creation playbook
Go find the person who's already doing this at a high level and pay whatever they're asking 

Be clear that your intention is to take it in house over the long haul

Start doing it with the vendor only. Then hire someone who will be the interface between the vendor and the internal, who has that skill set.

Get to the point eventually where you double your volume because you do half work from the vendor and have to work from internal. 

When the in-house person beats the vendor then you fire the vendor.

# [[Communication ]]

Communication is to create meaning and connection.

Adaptability grows empathy. Empathy builds [[trust]]. Need to diminish the ego. 

Driver vs amiable
Analytical vs Expressive.

Conversation types
Transactional 
Positional - establish position 
Transformational - how to elicit change

[[Trust]] is the glue.
Consistency, integrity, empathy 

Active Listening
You are learning only here.

Don't directly mirror last sentence. Bring back a previous thought to help them weave their narrative. You are providing functional utility. Help them [[structure]] your thoughts.
