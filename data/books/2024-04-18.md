# Daily Law
## Startle the Snakes

You can sit back and read the signs or you can actively work to uncover your enemies. In the Bible we read of David’s suspicion that his [[father]]-in-law, King Saul, secretly wanted him dead. How could David find out? He confided his suspicion to Saul’s son Jonathan, his close friend. Jonathan refused to believe it, so David suggested a test. He was expected at court for a feast. He would not go; Jonathan would attend and pass along David’s excuse, which would be adequate but not urgent. Sure enough, the excuse enraged Saul, who exclaimed, “Send at once and fetch him unto me—he deserves to die!” David’s test succeeded because it was ambiguous. His excuse for missing the feast could be read in more than one way: if Saul meant well toward David, he would have seen his son-in-law’s absence as no more than selfish at worst, but because he secretly hated David, he saw it as effrontery, and it pushed him over the edge. Follow David’s example: *say or do something that can be read in more than one way, that may be superficially polite but that could also indicate a slight coolness on your part or be seen as subtle insult.* A friend may wonder but will let it pass. The secret enemy, though, will react with [[anger]]. Any strong [[emotion]] and you will know that there’s something boiling under the surface.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Reflect on a time when you received unexpected kindness.

# [[Homo Deus]]
The real nemesis of the modern economy is not resource [[scarcity]] (which we can address with better technology to harness what we have and find new sources), but ecological collapse.

There are three types of resources: materials, [[Energy]], and [[knowledge]].
## the modern deal
By destroying the old tradition, we have freed ourselves and experience unparalleled growth, but at the cost of full [[responsibility]], of navigating [[uncertainty]] alone. 

Modernity is [[Chaos]], flux. [[Growth]] is the supreme value. Rapid growth means that no [[structure]] is allowed to ossify. We now fear equilibrium.

The rising sign shows you what's actually happening. 

[[The sun]] tells you what you need for creativity, joy, and fulfillment. 

The moon tells you what you need emotionally.

[[Julien Blanc]]. [[Anxiety]]
I wish I was…Julien says we don’t wish for anything different than what we were. A part of you has you own best interests at heart, but another part of you wants to stay where you are, your [[comfort]] zone. 

If you lose weight, you change who you are, you have new responsibilities, new [[risk]]y uncertain scenarios to navigate. New is scary. I could be rejected. [[Rejection]] hurts, [[rejection]] is scary. [[Rejection]] is what I already went through before with Myra Awan as a child. I don’t ever want to experience this again, even if it means I won’t experience anything as a result. No movement means no possibility of [[pain]]. Freezing is safety. 

Your comfort zone is your ceiling. 

I am escaping the void through [[self]]-improvement. [[Pain]] causes you to hit rock-bottom, you stop running, and you face it.

Face [[Fear]]’s bluff.

You need to be your own parent. 

Empathetic, loving, kind, gentle, but also firm and having boundaries of [[self]]-[[love]]. 

You need to face the monster in the closet. If you [[inner child]] was scared of a monster in the closet, you as a parent wouldn’t respond with “don't be a bitch, just tough it out” or even logically state “there’s no such thing as monsters, don’t be dumb”. 

You as a parent would also not respond by believing the child verbatim, “Oh you say there’s a monster? Then okay, that’s scary, you should hide and never look there”. You wouldn’t respond this way because you as the parent can hold a healthy boundary of what is real and not real. 

You would respond “I know that it’s scary, and it’s okay that it’s scary. Let’s face it together and I’ll be here every step of the way. ”

Your parent has no tolerance for [[abuse]]. You are abusing yourself with your mental attacks. With your fear and [[despair]]. You need to soothe and comfort yourself so that you know that no matter what, you won’t be alone, you’ll have your back. Someone will be there. 

You have to move forward with your own best interests at heart.

[[Self]]-[[love]] is the result of removing [[self]]-[[hate]].

If you go the mainstream [[self]]-help route, you will be able to optimize your comfort zone but you won't be able to break out.

To crush it, stand out in a relatable way.

Affirmations: only someone that hates themselves would need to affirm they [[love]] themselves.

Reframe a falsely held belief in a relatable way. 

Comfort zone, when we reach a ceiling, we sabotage back down, then [[self]] improvement to build up. This cycle gives the illusion of progress but it stays within the overall ceiling of your comfort zone. No real movement. 

Comfort zone ceiling held up by [[trauma]], core beliefs, and core identity.

## What is the payoff of [[procrastination]] and laziness? Of [[inertia]]? Of inaction? 
Safety. 
Known vs unknown.

### I was scared of the demonstration I was going to perform for Copilot. 
I internally felt a flash of a wish that the meeting would be cancelled so I wouldn’t have to face my fears, the anxiety, the [[risk]] of the unknown. If wishes were horses, then I sabotaged myself. The meeting ended up being cancelled and rescheduled for next week Wed. I wished against my [[fate]]. I am indeed holding myself back and I need to figure out how and why fast. 



## What stops you from acting in the here and now? If you could have what you wanted, what would it be? Next, what is stopping you from attaining that?

A beautiful girlfriend. This will take minimum 6 months. But this isn't a thing you control so let's just assume you had this already, what is your [[purpose]] then? How would you advertise to her that your [[purpose]] has meaning, that you have meaning? What is your meaning? What is your brand?

It was Data science, corporate hierarchy,, money, [[power]], prestige up until recently. 

After breakup with Ori, writing fantasy fiction was discovered. 

Now I have narrowed or broadened it to changing the way the world thinks. [[Homo Deus]] demonstrates that story is the primary driver of humanity. I want to change or contribute to the world story through whatever I do.

What is the best route for me to achieve that?

### I have a deep desire to be loved, to find someone
But this isn’t a [[purpose]]. This is a wound that blocks me from seeing my [[purpose]]. From pursuing my [[purpose]]. I can either hope for my [[love]] to come, or, the more rational path is to ignore my 

# Teleological: 
Relating to or involving the explanation of phenomena in terms of the [[purpose]] they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise

The belief that everything has a [[purpose]] or use. 

The study of ends or purposes. 

# Reddit post on a writer’s life
If I may ask, what do you do for a living? I am at a crossroads in life. Up until recently, I never dared to dream and so even if I had spent my entire life crafting this fantasy world in my head, writing just seemed stupidm, against my best interests. So I just pursued standard corporate type work in insurance and data analysis. 

Recently, I realized that it may be okay to dream and that I actually want to be a writer (fantasy fiction). I'm 36 and realizing this so I understand I have a lot of catching up to do. 

Now I am confused because I don't understand how I'm supposed to support myself and pursue my passion while giving my best [[self]] to my writing. Like you've stated, you have 1 maybe 2 (for some gifted/accomplished people) bouts of intense cognitive effort and the rest of your day is coasting. If I am to pursue this passion, I am unsure what kinds of jobs would be best to "pay the bills". Right now I am in in data analysis with some in my company pushing for me to be a data engineer and eventually a data scientist. I imagine this will be taxing on my brain and would leave room for little else other than consuming media rather than creating it. 

What kinds of jobs are recommend for paying the bills?
