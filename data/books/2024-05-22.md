# Daily Law
## Determine the Strength of People’s Character

Remember this: **weak character will neutralize all of the other possible good qualities a person might possess**. For instance, people of high intelligence but weak character may come up with good ideas and even do a job well, but *they will crumble under pressure, or they will not take too kindly to criticism, or they will think first and foremost of their own agenda, or their arrogance and annoying qualities will cause others around them to quit, harming the general [[environment]]*. There are hidden costs to working with them or hiring them. Someone less charming and intelligent but of strong character will prove more reliable and productive over the long run. People of real strength are as rare as gold, and if you find them, you should respond as if you had a discovered a treasure.

> Daily Law: In gauging strength or weakness, look at how people handle stressful moments and [[responsibility]]. Look at their patterns: what have they actually completed or accomplished?

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: List three things you’re grateful for about your neighborhood or community.

I have always hated my neighborhood and community. It’s a sore spot so this prompt is difficult. If I place my own biases aside, I can look for things that I *should* be grateful for. 

I am grateful for the greenery. I live across from a park and there are trees everywhere.

I live in an area that is a comfortable mix of urban and rural. It has just enough urbanization to have my material and shopping needs met without introducing the complexities of a heavily urbanized [[environment]]. I have space. I have time.

My neighborhood is safe, or at least I perceive it as so. I am comfortable going for a walk by myself. I mostly run into old people on my walks. 





[[Entrepreneurship]]
Team no bigger than 12, then doesn't get better than 40 ppl. 

Primary assets are media, IP, software, data, intangibles

Key person of influence creates a wake of opportunity that the team that monetizes the opportunity.

Bigger carrots and bigger sticks. Once you have enough money, you realize it's just a game, and when you play a game seriously, you want to get good at the game and vice versa. Instead of reading fiction, your life is fiction. 

Nicolas Cole

Do it everyday, the only way to alleviate the [[guilt]] of not putting in enough effort. 

It's not about what you want to write and get paid for. Instead, it's about what question in the world needs an answer, and answering that question. 

If you want to write for money (an external outcome), meet an external need.

There's a hesitance to do an activity out of personal choice. We live a life of being assigned tasks for external [[validation]]. Intrinsic [[motivation]] pretends it requires a direct deliverable similar to extrinsic per our training, however intrinsic [[motivation]] comes from realizing that all skills are transferable. Like a player level vs a class level. 

Master a skill vs an outcome (title).

The first step is to demonstrate that there's another option. Even making $1 shows you the possibility of more.

To be a creator, need to step out from the herd. We have a need to fit in, need to balance with standing out. Still should find tribe to meet underlying herd need. It won't go away, but it can be met in multiple ways and degrees. Not at the cost of your soul.

You can't steer a stationary ship. The end will reveal itself. Herd their thinking and write it. 

Ghostwriting. Transcribe their words and remove the fluff. Rev transcriptiin softwarre. Ghostwriting to learn how to write. Doing first for free removes friction. Starting for free proves your worth. Raises your skill, is actually the short path counterintuitively. Ghostwriting vs ghost-thinking.

Divorce time from outcome. 

See money as a business vs a consumer. Change how you see money. [[Time]] is the true value driver, not money. 

Sales copywriter - Gary Halpert. 

Barbell
[[Time]] saver or domain knowledge.
Save for time or expertise. 

Architect vs Archeologist 

SEO - I want to own that search term.

You want to write within the [[environment]] that everyone is hanging out in. [[Twitter]], LinkedIn currently best distribution. Also Quora, Medium.

Mechanics of Social Platform is ratio based, not quantity based for distribution. 

What should I write? 
For who
so that 

Just move. Iterate. Data driven lean writing approach. Let the [[environment]] guide you. This offloads cognitive load to [[environment]].
