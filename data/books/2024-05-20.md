# Daily Law
## The Unambitious Front

> Of all the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no one confesses to.
> 
> —Plutarch

When Ivan the Terrible died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene who could lead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would stir up envy and suspicion among the boyars, so he refused the crown, not once but several times. He made people insist that he take the throne. George Washington used the same strategy to great effect, first in refusing to keep the position of commander in chief of the American army, second in resisting the presidency. In both cases he made himself more popular than ever. People cannot envy the [[power]] that they themselves have given a person who does not seem to desire it.

> Daily Law: Be most suspicious of those who seem unambitious.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Express gratitude for the technology that makes your life easier.

# Misc

I need to learn [[time management]]. In order to do this, I need to learn mission management.

Metacognition.

# How to find your LEARNER TYPE & build a perfect study system

[](https://www.youtube.com/@JustinSung)

Deep Learning - raw processing [[power]].
[[Self]]-regulation - metacognition, technique.
Mindset - fixed vs growth mindset. How you frame [[emotions]]. Mistakes are desired, they are not avoided. Even if you could avoid them, you wouldn’t want to because they’re learning opportunities. 

Learner Types
1. Unchained - limited by mindset, the other two don’t really matter. After reframing mindset, energy is redirected and you see rapid growth.
2. The Sprout - early on their journey, need to build deep learning throughput and [[self]]-regulation techniques
3. The (Storm) Trooper - limited deep-processing, always trying different techniques but limited by raw throughput, there’s a ceiling to their efforts. 
4. Karps (magikarps) - Low [[self]]-regulation, ineffective methods, will suddenly evolve into Gyarados. 

## Quiz Result: **Unchained**

You have great potential that is likely limited by fixed beliefs and an aversion to making mistakes. Training a growth mindset is your highest priority.

# [[Alchemy]], [[Ayurveda]], and [[Carl Jung]]

Analyze Jungian MBTI types along the classical elements (exclude ether for now). So E/I is an element. N/S is an element, T/F corresponds to an element, J/P is corresponds to an element.

3 Paths - freedom vs safety
Safe - 
Alternate -
Radical -

Users/customers (internal and external) need introduction, primer, context before engagement with the product.

Key Man [[Risk]].

Daniel Priestley 
What problem am I trying to solve in the world?

[[Focus]] on what someone else needs, park your own needs.

Lead generation 

Logic, [[emotion]], urgency. Need a balance of all 3.

Humans need to know, [[trust]], a process of discovery. A series of steps. This is sales and marketing. 11 steps of discovery. 

Need to create a sense of urgency through transparent supply demand tension.

Coaching qualification.

Don't want to be a cog in the machine. Component labor. As a cog, You don't know it's stupid because it may reveal a crack in the cock and then you'll get replaced. 

Reptile, autopilot, visionary.

Join an entrepreneureal company. 

Ideation - select out of 10 ideas. 

Create an asset, sweat the asset, keep track

Strategy, financing, sales & marketing, hr, operations, hiring. 

When you've created a business, only the hard problems will trickle their way up to you. The easy stuff will be handled by ppl you hired. 

De-risking [[entrepreneurship]] - identify market signals. 

Signals: Event, scorecard, or waiting list.

Score card (like a quiz, ppl who respond could be leads).

Product Market Fit - find what your customer really wants.

Ideation, MVP, product Market Fit, got to market, scale up, exit

The Second Mountain. First is fun freedom flexibility. Second is invest, commit, home, cause. 

[[Entrepreneurship]] is like Legos. 

Look at an existing problem to build a solution vs old build skills and try to find employees that needs those skills with [[entrepreneurship]] your task is defined the solution for the business and sell it to them versus an employer already knowing their solution and selecting you for your skill set and ability to deliver that solution. With [[entrepreneurship]] you leverage [[uncertainty]] in your favor 

[[Entrepreneurship]] is semicolon making money making a profit, [[risk]] for both parties You are organizing resources beyond your control. A leader already has all resources under their control, like a [[trust]] fund baby. An entrepreneur needs to secure resources from beyond themselves. You need to influence people outside of your current sphere 

Management is generally for 6 to 12 people, anything after that you require a management teams. Under 10 people you're a [[self]]-organized team. Think of a dinner party. Does not require a lot of overhead until you pass this line 


## [[Jaswant]]’s reluctance to use a group chat to stay in the loop regarding family events

He said that he just doesn’t want to use the tool.
He doesn’t want every single family member in the chat, there are some people he wants and some he doesn’t. 
He feels that people’s schedules don’t line up.
He feels that it’s inconsiderate that people won’t call him to keep him in the loop.
He feels that there are some that adhere to tool use better than others and that for it to work, everyone needs to be on board and on the same page. 
I suggested that he is introverted and prefers small intimate deeper connections vs wide and shallow connections. He did not protest too much which to me means that he agreed. 


# [[Happiness]]
[[Mo Gawdat]]

[[Happiness]] is a choice. 

![[90 second rule]]

Absolute [[happiness]] is not a choice. Relative, incremental progress towards [[happiness]] is a choice. Absolute [[happiness]] is a destination, it is static, non-dual, and therefore cannot exist in space-time, duality. Incremental [[happiness]] is relative, dynamic, and is always a choice. The most important step a man can take is the next one. 

Genuine [[happiness]] is calm, peaceful contentment. It is static. Serenity. This is the base you start and end from. This is your reference point. Your orientation. Parasympathetic. Serotonin is only happy neurotransmitter. 

[[Dopamine]] is excitatory. Antagonistic with serotonin, can only have one. Keep chasing more and more dopamine due to higher baseline and compensatory down regulation that you don't allow by continually upping the dose.

Using fun as a painkiller as anesthesia, as avoidance. If you are coming from a place of contentment where there is nothing to relieve there's no [[pain]] then playing a video game is like taking a supplement, fun become supplementary to an already functioning system. 

When are you happy? It's not the events of your life. 

[[Happiness]] equations: [[happiness]] is equal to (or less than) (perception of) events minus expectations.

[[Happiness]] is the default state, unhappiness is due to deviations. Every negative [[emotion]] is a survival threat, a reaction to a perceived survival threat. With unhappiness because it only lasts 90 seconds we keep refreshing and enhancing it to keep make it persist. To maintain awareness in case the threat is still there.

[[Ambition]] higher than a realistic expectation. And expectations that are lower than the line of feasibility. 

We are all millionaires in The resource of time, we have 500,000 hours, 30 million minutes of life. We exchange this time for money at certain conversion rates. Question which our favorable ROIs. 

If [[happiness]] is achieved by comparison then look down instead of up as the stoics did, simulate suffering. 

Life gives each of us our own bespoke tests that we are just barely capable of achieving. 

Helping others will convince the universe to help you because the universe wants to help everyone. [[Compassion]] is selfish, it is about making yourself feel good and that's okay. 

Qualities and traits, [[dualities]], masculinity and femininity go wrong based on intensity, when you go too far. For example masculinity in healthy doses is protection of the tribe versus in excess turns into aggression and violence.

Too much intuition is impractical. 

The answer is balance, and exchange.
