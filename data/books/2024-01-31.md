I lack a trait, I am in a state of lack. I identify that I need to stretch outside of my comfort zone. I work up the nerve to stretch outside of my comfort zone. I stretch out of my comfort zone. It is inevitably messy. Because it is a stretch, I invariably make a mistake afterwards. The [[pain]] of [[regret]] builds and builds and there is no relief because I cannot change the past. [[Regret]] subsides. In the future, I have [[fear]]/[[anxiety]] about stretching because of anticipated [[regret]]/[[failure]].
