I asked the question: how should I proceed regarding my situation at SCJ (the company I work for) (a [[career]] based question but specific to the organization I work for)?

3 card spread:
Card 1: 5 of swords reversed
Card 2: The Emperor reversed
Card 3: The Hermit

In this three-card spread, you asked how to proceed with your situation at SCJ. Let’s explore the cards and the guidance they offer:

1. Five of Swords Reversed (Current Situation/Challenge)

The Five of Swords reversed suggests that the situation you are dealing with at SCJ may involve conflict or tension that is on the verge of resolution, or at least de-escalation. In the upright position, this card typically represents conflict, dishonesty, or [[power]] struggles. However, in its reversed form, it can indicate a desire to move past disagreements, find compromise, and resolve any lingering tensions.

In this position, it could be advising you to seek [[peace]] and let go of any residual [[resentment]] or frustration. You may need to [[focus]] on healing fractured [[relationships]] with colleagues or within the organizational [[environment]]. It’s a call to avoid getting pulled into further conflict or pettiness and to rise above the fray.

Guidance: Approach any existing or potential disputes with a mindset of reconciliation rather than revenge or one-upmanship. [[Focus]] on moving forward without holding grudges, and consider that stepping back from any battle may give you clarity on how to act next.

2. The Emperor Reversed (Advice/What to [[Focus]] On)

The Emperor reversed represents a disruption in authority, [[structure]], or control. It may suggest that the leadership at SCJ is disorganized, overly rigid, or lacks direction. This could also reflect how you are feeling—perhaps stifled by an overbearing system or authority figure. The reversed Emperor often points to the need to re-evaluate [[power]] dynamics and control. Are you feeling powerless, or are you being too controlling yourself?

In the advice position, this card indicates that you should reflect on how authority and [[structure]] (or the lack thereof) are affecting your [[career]]. Are you being micromanaged, or is there a lack of leadership that makes your path unclear? The advice here is to be mindful of how much control you exert versus how much you allow others to control you. It may be [[time]] to challenge ineffective systems or poorly managed leadership structures, but with tact.

Guidance: Avoid [[power]] struggles, but don't hesitate to assert your boundaries. Work on establishing clear personal goals and regain a sense of autonomy in your role. A more flexible approach may be needed, but don’t compromise your integrity.

3. The Hermit (Outcome/Future Potential)

The Hermit is a deeply reflective card, representing introspection and the search for inner [[wisdom]]. In the outcome position, it suggests that in order to navigate your [[career]] path successfully at SCJ, you will benefit from taking a step back to reflect and assess the situation independently. The Hermit encourages you to seek [[solitude]], not necessarily in a physical sense, but in a way that allows you to detach from external pressures and distractions to gain clarity.

This card implies that you might find your way forward through [[self]]-examination and patience. The solutions you seek won’t come through external [[validation]] but through trusting your inner [[wisdom]]. It can also indicate that you may need to explore alternative perspectives or even consider mentoring or advice from someone more experienced.

Guidance: Take [[time]] for [[self]]-reflection and strategic thinking. This may mean distancing yourself temporarily from office politics or ongoing issues to [[focus]] on long-term goals. [[Trust]] your intuition and be willing to go on this journey of personal discovery to realign with your true [[career]] aspirations.

Summary:

The Five of Swords reversed calls for resolving tensions and stepping away from conflict, promoting harmony instead.

The Emperor reversed encourages you to reflect on authority dynamics and control issues, advocating for balance between asserting yourself and avoiding unnecessary [[power]] struggles.

The Hermit suggests a period of introspection and personal guidance, where the answers you seek about your [[career]] at SCJ will come from within, rather than from external influences.


How to Proceed:

Avoid conflicts at work, even if it means being the one to extend an olive branch or take the high road.

Re-evaluate [[power]] structures within the organization and your role. You might need to assert yourself, but be wary of rigid, controlling behavior—whether from others or within yourself.

Engage in deep reflection about what you truly want from your [[career]] and how SCJ fits into your long-term plans. Allow yourself [[time]] and space to gain clarity before making any drastic decisions.
