[[Reincarnation]]
Most of the time, your childhood has to do with your previous lifetime. Mostly the things that were not resolved in that time was carried over into this lifetime.

Sure!
We often think of "[[karma]]" as some magical force, but [[karma]] literally means "action."
It's a mechanistic process. action begins as a thought, evolves into a word, and culminates in a deed. Each stage is imbued with increasingly dense intention.

When we encounter a present moment we don't like, we resist it, however that resistance can only occur on the level of thought. We think "Why can't it be like this instead?" So by illusion of control, I'm referring to fantasizing about some alternative present moment. It's masturbatory.

You're probably thinking: "If I see a rock in my path, I can just move around it." You're right. However, in order to change the present moment, we must first accept it in its entirety. [[Acceptance]] allows us to orient ourselves so that we can course correct accurately.
