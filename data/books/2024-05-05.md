# Daily Law
## Be Careful Whom You Offend

In the fifth-century BC, Ch’ung-erh, the prince of Ch’in (in present-day China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly—even, sometimes, in poverty—waiting for the time when he could return home and resume his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where the ruler, not knowing who he was, treated him rudely. Years later, the prince was finally able to return home, his circumstances greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to him, and who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of all did he forget his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity he assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng, taking eight cities, destroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own. Never assume that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less important than you are. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of [[power]] tomorrow. We forget a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult.

> Daily Law: Swallow the impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is meager compared to the danger that someday he or she will be in a position to hurt you.

# Daily [[Gratitude]]: Think about a time when you attended a memorable event.


# Creativity and Production are two different activities

Pruning. Cut back rampant growth to promote growth. Signal to noise ratio. This may refer to my thoughts, my data intake is out of control.

Sometimes at the top, you can see more vs being on the ground. 

Review your recurring dream of finding yourself too high and needing to come down safely. 

## Lanes

Slow lane - safest but there’s a lot of people, you might not get to where you’re trying to go.

The middle lane might be faster, but there may be less people.

The fastest lane, you will have to drive faster, but it is allowed. If you go any slower, you may cause damage to other people. It is meant for overtaking. If you don’t know what you’re doing, and you’re not prepared to do what you need to do, you will be wasting yours and others’ time.

# How a space can improve (or destroy) your life

Automate good decisions by outsourcing the decision to your [[environment]]. The Dorito effect - eating just one Dorito is hard, eating zero Doritos is easy.

Remove friction from actions or habits you want to cultivate.

Reduce environmental noise. Increase signal-to-noise ratio.



Strategies:
	Decluttering
	Good storage systems
	Desk optimiziation
	ergonomic work stations
	Feng shui
	IKEA effect - you form emotional attachments to furniture you build yourself.
	Through lines
		Your home is your tailored sanctuary
		Clutter bad
		Nature, art, plants, good
		Decorative objects should be functional, purposeful. Even a small [[purpose]] such as reminding you to have a nice day.
		Does your [[environment]] and environmental decisions spark joy?
		We are more happy solving space problems than we do create space features. Removing [[pain]] points feels better than creating new sources of [[happiness]].
		Surface is not storage.
		**Your space should reflect the person you want to be.**

Space ([[environment]]) reinforces your identity which reinforces your habits.
	Your best [[self]] lives in something that looks straight out of Pinterest

# [[The Millionaire Fast Lane]]

>[[Wealth]] is the ability to fully experience life. 
– [[Henry David Thoreau]]

[[Wealth]] = Family, fitness, freedom.

I have always been wealthy, abundant minded. It is my innate state, despite my [[environment]], despite my circumstances. 
## The Sidewalk
No plan, no savings, today over tmrw. Instant gratification. 

Output greater than input.

Poorness in time and money. 

Faux [[wealth]] destroys real [[wealth]] through destroying health and [[relationships]]. 

Servitude (Slavery) is the opposite of freedom.

Lifestyle servitude: Work for income, income for lifestyle, lifestyle requires work.

[[Luck]] is the residue of process.

Take [[responsibility]] and accountability to avoid [[self]]-victimization. Own your own decisions. This alchemizes failures into [[wisdom]] because it's your data. 

# [[Game Theory]]

> Knowing the other and knowing oneself, In one hundred battles no danger,

> Not knowing the other and knowing oneself, One victory for one loss,

> Not knowing the other and not knowing oneself, In every battle certain defeat

# Unrealistic demands

This whole time, I’ve been demonizing the [[superego]] for making unrealistic demands of my [[inner child]], however it may be that the [[inner child]] has been making the unrealistic demands this entire time, like a spoiled child wanting every toy in the store, regardless of whether the parent can afford it. It’s not even that the parent can’t afford it, rather, a child can’t even play with that many toys. It just wants for the sake of wanting.

My [[inner child]]’s needs outstrip my [[inner parent]]’s capacity.

# “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.”

I need a plan, a goal, a north star. Otherwise all roads will seem equally appealing. I can’t be expected to discern the correct path by traversing the territory. I need a map.

[[Victoria]]
I no longer accept living vicariously through "[[proxy experiences]]". If I want to experience new worlds, I need to travel to new places and meet new people. If I want to slay dragons, I need to achieve huge and tangible goals in the [[external world]]. I am hungry for new experiences...in fact, I am starving and at some point in my life I, [[Amrit]] used video games to escape a reality that told me (in fact, I lied to myself) that I can't have what I want out of life because I'm not strong enough. Additionally, now that I have some distance, I've realized they are a habit that uses up way too much time and for me, have a low return on investment as measured by feeling fulfilled. They represent to high of an opportunity cost (with how I used to use gaming).
