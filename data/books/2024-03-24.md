# Daily [[Gratitude]]

# [[Jaswant]]:  
## [[Spirits]]:  
I will help them, but I personally don't endorse it.  
I don't need to open these doors, I'm not interested.  
Each person is different, we each have our own path to walk.  
Without proof, a belief is meaningless.  

### Example:  
If an energy-worker patient needs help, I will deal with it, but I am not an active participant, I will deal with it. If someone needs info, I will deep dive.  
  
Most people talk about the spirit kingdom. There are different levels.  
  
I don't walk into anyone else's space.  
  
Doesn't matter what area or line you walk into, what you reason, but it needs to be accurate.  

## Scientific method, test your hypothesis.  
Answer is a yes or a no. There is no in-between. To get to 100% accuracy, you need to see it from many different angles, including you actually trying it out. Even if you confirm for yourself, you only get to about 50%.  
   
### How do you design the right experiment?  
  
You can't step in the same river twice. How do you objectively test something that is constantly shifting?  
  
If you get more Yes's, or if you your Yes's are 80% or higher. Good enough vs perfection.  
  
You need to work at it to get enough data points.  
  
You want to find paths or angles that you can actually walk, that are safe to walk.  

#### Example: Chakras 
How can I test for something that is constantly shifting? There are times where I can feel things, there are times where I can't feel things.

## [[Risk]] 
for example, crossing a road, there is a [[risk]] that there is oncoming traffic. You have to take chances that are safe enough for you, but you do need to take risks.

## Using my own thoughts
Until you've arrived at your own conclusions, they won't be yours. They won't have the same meaning, the same potency. 

Using someone else's path is not for you. 

You can use a bibliography. You can have references.

### Example: spiritual healing, channelers
What is actually happening here?

Correlation vs causation.

### Why I'm being defensive regarding your parents
You said that you pitied them. I objected. I said I don't actually care about them, I am saying this for your benefit.

When you said you pitied them, from the despise-angle. From despise, to hate, to pity. Then after this, look at this from the energy angle. Analyze this from the [[psychology]]. 
#### Your use of the word "pity" implies a [[power]] dynamic
If you are interested in the energy angle, analyze.

If someone is in [[pain]], why use the word "pity"?

First get your foundation in order.

I usually don't blame others for something that is causally linked to something I've done?
##### If I don't like someone, I own it. I don't let my guard down. 
Once you've solved your own problem, it's easier to establish cause on [[self]] vs others.

Do I actually care whether you do the work or not? No. I don't refuse people, but I am an outsider. Sometimes there is no need to rush. It is very frustrating.

## Pantheism
I explained my view that what I meant by spirit is that spirit is similar to the conception of string theory in that spirit, which I labelled consciousness, vibrates at different frequencies. The faster the vibration, the more conscious, the more energy. Similar to how low frequency sounds can be felt in your stomach whereas high pitched sounds are almost indiscernible, they have an etheric quality to them.

### His response was: "They are basically all physical angles."
I take this to mean that there is no distinction between matter and energy which agrees with physics. While I was stating that it is all energy, it almost sounded like he was emphasizing that it is all matter. Or that it is all real, tangible, manipulatable, sensible. 
# Tablet use cases
## I want a tablet that sits between a smartphone and a desktop. 
A niche with the least redundancy. 

My smartphone is portable, it generally does not have access to a keyboard, and it captures through voice and texting with my thumbs. It is the least powerful.

My desktop is not portable at all, however I sit at my desk for large periods of my day. The desktop takes care of all of my "[[power]]" use cases. 

Therefore a tablet should offer more [[power]] than a smartphone and more portability than a desktop. The portability (or lack thereof) of a desktop means that is tied to a desk. Therefore my tablet should not rely on sitting at a desk to function. That would be a laptop. As a result, the Galaxy Tab s8 Ultra is not the correct model for me. 


# Fearing [[Abandonment]]
[[Abandonment]] is part of the human condition. 

Both secure and insecure attachments will suspect that people in their life will abandon them. No matter what, you will be abandoned, because we are mortal and everyone eventually dies. 

## The difference lies in perspective. 
### Insecure attachment
Suspects [[abandonment]] at every turn. They fear [[abandonment]] around every corner, so as a result, they do everything they can to avoid that fear that results from [[abandonment]]. They are driven by the [[emotion]] of fear. This fear results from using others in their [[relationships]] to compliment or make up for a trait, ability, learning, lesson, identity, piece of themselves that they are missing as a result of wounds in their past that resulted in the insecure attachment paradigm. 

#### Others are a means to the end of emotional complementation.
As you use others, you become attached to them. You need them. Like tools. What you blame, you give [[power]] to. By outsourcing your psychic integrity to others, you give them your [[power]], your autonomy, your agency. As a result the loss of their absence is not just tragic, it's catastrophic. 
### Secure attachment
Suspects [[abandonment]] at every turn, as it is a natural part of existence. However, as opposed to fear, they instead choose to [[love]], to cherish the [[beauty]] of connection they have with others, despite the ephemeral nature of the human condition. [[Memento mori]]. [[Amor fati]]. 

#### Treat others as an end to themselves
They are secure so they are not using others to compensate for what they lack because they aren't lacking in any major area. Others do not exist as mechanisms to shore up inner deficiencies.

They have a "good enough" proficiency in each area of their psyche. They were able to master or pass each of these lessons during childhood. If not in childhood, they were somehow able to learn these lessons later in life. As a result, they have the freedom, the liberty, to not treat others as means to the end of emotional complementation. Both partners in a relationship are ends to themselves. It is a meeting of ends and as a result, the loss of an end is tragic, but not catastrophic.


# PKMS
I separated my novel into it's own vault. I want to perfect my workflow for my personal life before I take on the undertaking of learning and then writing a novel. I know that some have stated that you are wasting too much time "sharpening the sword" but I just feel like I have to master this skill. PKMS is a skill. 

## Zotero
[[Annotations Ch.1]]
I have also settled on using Xodo to annotate and read PDF eBooks. I have also downloaded Zotero to export all of my annotations as a markdown file. Next I need to find how to incorporate the [[Obsidian]] plugin for Zotero. All of this  sounds like such a hassle, so much friction. Technology should just work like I imagine it to damn it. Alternatively, this highlights areas in which I may be able to deliver value. A way to make money to support my writing.
