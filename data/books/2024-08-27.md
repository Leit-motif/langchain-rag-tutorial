Those who have lived a life with [[depression]] and anxiety have lived a Plutonian life, they have lived alongside death every day. These are Thanatos. They are the opposite of the feelings of abundance, libido.

Pluto asks that we trust in a dark [[God]], an unseen [[God]]. Pluto asks us to have faith in all of the death, the suffering, the dissolution. 

Some of you may have felt broken by it. Some of you may have engaged yourself. And some of you may have been broken to engage yourself. This transformation has been pivotal, it has been powerful. It's not about being lost and having been found. It's about having journey down into the lower depth of yourself being asked to make the journey up but there's a condition Don't look back Don't look over your shoulder to see if the thing you've been seeking, your inner Eurydice that you went to Hell to retrieve, The deeper part of yourself, it's stepping as you step it's walking as you walk, so you're not going to hear it or sense it. You need to trust it is there, it is following you, in your shadow, in your wake, it will always be in your blind spot because it supports you. It's the hidden. If you can trust in its following you, and in the strength that comes from having made that journey then you will feel a strength assertiveness and a courage in your life unlike anything ever felt before and that is Pluto's great gift. With loss come something irreplaceable. 

All of our decisions are motivated by death. The avoidance of death. To be alone means death. To not have enough money means death. To not be secure means death. To not have [[sex]] means death of the lineage. Is libidos the avoidance of death or the pursuit of Life?

## Interpretation 1

### 1. **Ace of Pentacles (Reversed)**

The Ace of Pentacles in reverse suggests that you might be feeling a sense of missed opportunities or stagnation in your career. This card often points to delays, financial instability, or a lack of growth. You may have had high hopes for a new venture or project, but it hasn’t materialized as you expected. It’s important to evaluate if you’re grounding your efforts in practical actions or if something is blocking your prosperity. This card advises you to revisit your plans, ensure your foundation is strong, and perhaps consider new strategies to achieve your goals.

### 2. **Justice (Reversed)**

Reflect on whether you’re staying true to your values or if external factors are pushing you into uncomfortable situations. The energy of this card calls for careful consideration and a realignment with what you know to be right and just.

### 3. **Two of Pentacles (Reversed)**

The Two of Pentacles reversed highlights the struggle of juggling multiple responsibilities. It suggests that you might be overwhelmed, leading to stress and an inability to effectively manage your tasks. This card warns of a lack of balance, possibly due to overcommitting or not prioritizing properly. It’s essential to take a step back and reassess how you’re allocating your time and energy. Are there things you can delegate or areas where you need to simplify? Bringing your life into balance is key to moving forward.

This reading encourages you to take a closer look at where things may have gone off course and make necessary adjustments to bring about the stability and fairness you seek in your career.

## Interpretation 2

1. Current Workload: My current workload is relatively small, however this gives me free time to engage in self-guided learning. There is talk that I may be required to engage in answering customer support emails and I do not want to do that as it would leave no time for my self-guided learning. My work is unfulfilling, I see it as a stepping stone, however this stepping stone has lasted 2 years now and it's going nowhere.
2. Work-Life Balance: My career is a dead-end job, and I use my home life worrying about how to become an entrepreneur, and then feeling guilty when I need recreation time because I'm so emotionally drained from forcing myself through the day in my dead-end job.
3. Support System: I do not have a support system. The person I have delegated to has been complaining and wants me to take some of the workload for the user support requests.
4. Stress Levels: There is work stress because my work is also a toxic environment. There are office politics and my boss' boss does not like me. I am kept isolated from opportunities and new projects, thus cementing that I am stuck in my dead-end role. I am also stressed out by my coworker. We do not get along and she is constantly a hassle to work with. I have been stuck working with her as opposed to being assigned to new projects.
5. Future Aspirations: I want to become an entrepreneur in the long-term, however I am considering quitting my job so as to unburden myself and devote myself to entrepreneurship. On the other hand, I am applying to various jobs however I have not received any responses.

Given the specifics of your situation, the message from the Two of Pentacles reversed becomes clearer and more poignant. Here's how this card applies to your circumstances:

### **Juggling Responsibilities and Priorities**

The Two of Pentacles reversed emphasizes the growing difficulty in balancing your current responsibilities and your aspirations. Although your workload is currently manageable, the potential addition of answering customer support emails could significantly tip the scales, leaving you with little time for self-guided learning, which you see as crucial for your future entrepreneurial goals. This situation is likely to exacerbate your feelings of being trapped in a dead-end role.

### **Burnout and Stress**

You are already experiencing stress due to your toxic work environment and the lack of support. The reversed Two of Pentacles is a clear warning that adding more to your plate—like customer support duties—without proper support or balance will likely lead to burnout. The card suggests that you're at a critical juncture where continuing down this path without making changes will further drain your energy and could hinder your entrepreneurial pursuits.

### **Decision-Making and Reprioritization**

This card challenges you to reassess how you're allocating your time and energy. The fact that your current job feels like a dead-end and the additional responsibilities threaten to encroach on your learning time suggests that it's time to make some tough decisions. This could mean setting firm boundaries at work, such as declining the additional tasks, or more drastically, considering an exit strategy to focus on your long-term goals.

### **Isolation and Lack of Support**

The lack of a supportive environment both at work and in your personal life is a significant issue. The Two of Pentacles reversed often indicates that trying to manage everything on your own is unsustainable. Since your coworker is not supportive and your workload may increase, it’s important to recognize the need for external support. This could mean seeking advice from mentors, joining entrepreneurial communities, or finding ways to network with like-minded individuals who can offer guidance and encouragement.

### **Considering a Career Transition**

Given that your current job is unfulfilling and your aspirations lie in entrepreneurship, the reversed Two of Pentacles suggests that now might be the time to seriously consider a transition. While the card doesn't necessarily advise impulsive actions, it does point out the danger of remaining in a situation that continually drains you without offering anything in return.

### **Moving Forward**

- **Set Boundaries**: Try to protect your time for self-guided learning. If possible, politely but firmly refuse the additional responsibilities that threaten your future plans.
- **Explore Exit Strategies**: Consider how you can exit your current role, whether by saving money to support yourself during a job search or starting your entrepreneurial venture.
- **Seek Support**: Even if you lack a traditional support system, there are online communities, mentorship programs, and professional networks that can offer guidance and emotional support as you navigate this transition.

In summary, the Two of Pentacles reversed is urging you to recognize the unsustainable nature of your current situation and to take proactive steps to realign your life with your long-term goals. It’s time to prioritize your future over temporary [[security]] and to seek out the support you need to make your entrepreneurial dreams a reality.
